# This is a sample option configuration file for the command line sample
# programs.  This is not part of the HTML Export technology, merely a
# sample user interface for a program that demonstrates the
# export technology.
#
# Some comments on the format of this file.
#
# 1) Options are set with lines of the form:
#
#    option value
#
# 2) Lines that begin with the '#' character are comments.  The '#'
#    must appear at the beginning of the line.  If it appears
#    anywhere else it is treated as normal text.  Any text can appear
#    in a comment.  Lines that set options MAY NOT also contain
#    comments. 
#
# 3) If an option is set more than once in this file, the last value
#    seen is the one used by the program.
#
# 4) Options and values are not case sensitive (except for file and
#    font names).
#
# 5) For convenience only, most options are listed in the order they
#    appear in the Export manual.  The exceptions are the "output id",
#    "SCCOPT_EX_TEMPLATE" and "SCCOPT_EX_CALLBACKS" options.
#    
# 6) Additional options are present for use with EXREDIR which supports 
#	 testing callbacks.
#
# 7) The recognized values for all options are given below.
#    Nothing other than the value may appear on a line where an
#    option is set.

# file being converted.  It is also the font used when the font used
# in a source file is not available on the system performing the
# conversion. 
#
# Note: This option only affects the conversion of vector graphic
#       images when the font specified in the original document is
#       not available on the system doing the conversion.  It does
#       not affect in any way the <font> tags used for text markup 
#       in the output. 
#
# The name of the font. For example, "Helvetica Compressed" (quotes
# required if there is a space in the font name).

# SCCOPT_GRAPHIC_SIZELIMIT
#
# Graphic Size Limit.  This is used to limit the size of exported graphics.

#
# When this option is set to TRUE, Outside In will use its internal graphics rendering code 
# to produce bitmap output files whenever possible. This option enables Outside In 
# to render images without using the operating system's native graphics subsystem (X11 on
# Unix/Linux or Windows GDI on Windows platforms.) Note that this option only has an effect when
# Outside In has been installed with support for both native graphics and internal graphics "output

# or Unix system.
#
# tempdir /home/MyHome/MyTempDir


# SCCOPT_UNMAPPABLECHAR
#
# Unmappable Character.  This is the character used when a character
# cannot be found in the output character set.  The replacement
# character is specified as a hex Unicode value.  It is the user's

#              (Exredir specific) Callback Version 1 or 2 Options              #
################################################################################
#
# Everything below here is only used by the exredir sample app.
# All other sample apps ignore these settings.


# These next two config file options (cmcallbackversion and
# cmcallbackcharset) are related to the new "version 2" OEM Output
# and Process Element String callbacks.  They are NOT part of the
# Export API, but rather they are used by exredir sample application
# to determine how exredir will interact with Export.


# Callback version selection
#
# The first config file option determines whether to use the version
# 1 (OEMOUTPUT, PROCESSELEMENTSTR) or the version 2 callbacks
# (OEMOUTPUT_VER2, PROCESSSELEMENTSTR_VER2).  In HTML Export, the
# version 1 callbacks have been deprecated and may be dropped from a
# future release.  
#
#cmcallbackversion 1
cmcallbackversion 2


# dwCharset - Value passed into the EX_CALLBACK_ID_OEMOUTPUT_VER2 and
#             EX_CALLBACK_ID_PROCESSELEMENT_VER2 to specify what
#             character set is used by the contents of pwBuffer.
#
# This option is used ONLY when cmcallbackversion is set to "2".  It
# is used for strings passed to Export by the OEM (in this case,
# exredir takes the role of the OEM).  This is independent of the
# SCCOPT_UNICODECALLBACKSTR option, which indicates the character set
# of strings passed to the OEM by Export. 
#
# A special encoding mechanism is provided by the exredir sample
# application (NOT Export) to assist with using double byte character
# set strings in this config file.  The encoding mechanism may only
# be used by the "oem", "oemoutput" and "processelement" options
# below.  Such strings are encoded in the config file as hex word
# strings.  This is done by specifying a colon (:) followed by the
# hex digits.
#
# For example, the word "joe" would be encoded as:
# processelement :006A006F0065
#
# The string will be converted using the byte ordering of the
# platform, so the config file doesn't have to be changed when moving
# from one platform to another.
#
# NOTE: UTF-8 is not supported.  This is because the VER2 callbacks
# require word strings in the ** Export API **.  So characters
# entered in single-byte character sets must be padded to conform to
# the word length, as in the above example.  UTF-8 is not supported
# because its encodings can not always be constrained to 16 bits per
# character.

# EX_CALLBACK_ID_ENTERARCHIVE
#
# Exredir prints messages based on the information in this callback.


# EX_CALLBACK_ID_GRAPHICEXPORTFALIURE
#
# This callback is always handled by exredir and uses no options in
# this configuration file.


# EX_CALLBACK_ID_LEAVEARCHIVE
#
# Exredir prints messages based on the information in this callback.


# EX_CALLBACK_ID_NEWFILEINFO
#
# When set to "yes", exredir will print to stderr information about
# each new file generated by Export.
#
#handlenewfileinfo yes
handlenewfileinfo no


# EX_CALLBACK_ID_OEMOUTPUT and EX_CALLBACK_ID_OEMOUTPUT_VER2
#
# The OEM output strings callback handler will output the "oemoutput"
# string corresponding to the "oem" string encountered in the
# template.  So, for example, when {## Insert OEM=phone} is found in
# the template, "555-1212" will be written to the output file.  Or
# when version 2 callbacks are in use and "VER2_SayItAintSo" is found
# in the template "joe" will be written to the output file.
#
#oem phone
#oemoutput 555-1212
#oem piano
#oemoutput Korg
#oem plane
#oemoutput Boeing
#oem VER2_SayItAintSo

# EX_CALLBACK_ID_PROCESSLINK
#
# Specifies the action to take when a link is to be converted.  For
# the "create" action, specify the URL to be output with the 
# "linklocation" string.
#
#linkaction convert
#linkaction create
#linkaction skip
#linklocation images/next.gif


# EX_CALLBACK_ID_REFLINK
#
# Specifies if exredir should generate it's own URLs in response to this
# callback.  If set to "yes" then exredir will generate URLs of the form
# "wzFullName=pSubdocSpec", where wzFullName and pSubdocSpec are taken from
# the information provided by the callback.  Since the returned RefLink must
# be URL-encoded, any characters in wzFullName that are not allowed in a
# URL will be pseudo-URL-encoded.
#
#reflink yes
reflink no

#
# This option turns on or off the gimmick in exredir that converts all
# instances of the letter "z" in the output to the letter "q".  There
# is no real purpose to this function except to demonstrate that the
# IO of the Export process has been redirected.  This conversion does
# not happen on graphics output files.

#ZtoQ yes
ZtoQ no



# SCCOPT_EX_CALLBACKS
