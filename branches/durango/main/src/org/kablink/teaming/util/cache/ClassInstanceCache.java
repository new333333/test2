 * Manages a cache of singleton object instances where cache entry is referenced by 
 * the class name. To take advantage of this facility, the class must meet this
 * criteria:<p>
 * 1. The class follows singleton concept, where a single instance of the class
 * can serve all requests.  
 * 2. However, the class must NOT be designed to depend on the enforcement of 
 * singleton pattern. In other word, the class must NOT bomb out when more than
 * one instance of the class is actually created. 
 * 3. The class instance must be safe for multi-threaded access. Consequently,
 * the instance should never use instance variables to store state information
 * on a per-invocation basis.
