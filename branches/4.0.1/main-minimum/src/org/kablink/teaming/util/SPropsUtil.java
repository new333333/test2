/**
 * This class provides unified access to the SSF properties loaded from the 
 * properties file(s). Normally system has one such properties file, i.e., 
 * ssf.properties. But the system allows overriding of certain properties
 * without modifying the factory-shipped config file by creating additional
 * properties file and adding it to the appropriate list in the application
 * context config file (i.e., applicationContext.xml). This makes it easy
 * to upgrade system when it is expected that there will be large amount of
 * customizations performed. In fact, the system allows for any number of
 * such properties files to be chained.
