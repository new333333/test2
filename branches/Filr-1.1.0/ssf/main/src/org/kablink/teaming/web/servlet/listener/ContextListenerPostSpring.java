		// which means that a previous interactive session may still be good after node restart.
		// In that case, it makes sense to allow previous tokens associated with the resurrected session
		// to be also reusable. To prevent stale tokens from being used indefinitely, the runtime needs
		// to check and validate the association between the token and the currently-active session
		// in the context of which the remote app is being executed.
		// (c) If Teaming is ever configured to support replicated sessions (i.e., a configuration
		// where a session is not exclusively owned by a node, but rather shared among them), then
		// it becomes even harder or impossible to identity ownership of tokens. In that scenario, 
		// token cleanup at the individual node level isn't quite plausible.
