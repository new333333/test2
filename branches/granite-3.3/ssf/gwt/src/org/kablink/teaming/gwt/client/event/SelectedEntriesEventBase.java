/**
 * The SelectedEntriesEventBase is used as a base class for those
 * events that operation against the selected entries in a folder.
 * 
 * Typically, the extender of this class will NOT provide it with any
 * EntityId's.  They'll be obtained by the context the event was fired
 * from (e.g., in a data table, they'll be the entities that are
 * currently selected.)
 * 
 * The purpose of passing in selected entities is to 'piggy back' on
 * the handling of the operations of the extender's on one or more
 * entities INSTEAD of using those selected.  It is used this way to
 * implement the action menu associated with items in a data table.
 * For those, the event is created with the EntityId of the item whose
 * action menu was selected and then the event is fired, which then
 * uses the event implementor's logic to implement the action.
