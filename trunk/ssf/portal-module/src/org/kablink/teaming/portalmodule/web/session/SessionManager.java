 * This class serves as a bridge between the portal and the sitescape
 * portlet application and is deployed directly into the portal rather
 * than packaged with the sitescape app.
 * <p>
 * The primary utility of this class is to provide mechanism for managing
 * SSF sessions for users in such a manner that the lifecycle of SSF
 * sessions become entirely subordinate to that of portal sessions.  
 * (i.e., whan a portal session is created, corresponding SSF session is
 * created; when the portal session times out or gets invalidated, the
 * corresponding SSF session gets invalidated as well, etc.)
