  <content>Prerequisites You need a few things before you install Novell Teaming: Computer: Minimum 2 GHz processor Multi-CPU systems preferred Minimum 2 GB RAM You can potentially run with less RAM for specific development and testing configurations without simultaneous users, lots of database traffic, etc. Linux systems need to have a minimum open file limit of 4096. For SUSE® Linux Enterprise Sever (SLES), check /etc/security/limits.conf : * hard nofile 65535 * soft nofile 4096 See for details. Sun* JDK 1.5.0_011 or higher or the IBM JDK 1.5 installed (NOTE: Java* 1.6 is not yet supported). Sun* has changed the name of JDK 1.5 to 5.0. In this manual, any reference to the JDK 1.5 refers to JDK 5.0, see http://java.sun.com for more information. A database server: MySQL* 5.0.26 (or higher) Server and Client for Linux or MySQL 5.0.26 (or higher) Server and Client for Windows. MySql 5.0.26 ships with SUSE® Linux Enterprise Sever (SLES) 10 SP1. MySQL 5.1 is not yet supported. SQL Server* for Windows* (2000 or 2005) Oracle* 9, 10 Enough disk space for the software and for the data files: This depends on how much data you plan to put into the system. See sections and . The software takes about 250 MB. See for details. </content>

  <title>Steps for Installing Novell Teaming</title>
  <url>../b9vchn6.html</url>
  <content>Steps for Installing Novell Teaming Install the JDK. The Sun JDK 1.5.0_011 (or higher) or the IBM JDK version 1.5 is supported. Java 1.6 is currently not supported. You can download the Sun JDK from java.sun.com . Select the “JDK/JRE - 5.0” product line and download the JDK. The IBM JDK 1.5 is available on the SLES 10 distribution. Use YAST to select and install the IBM JDK. Larger deployments with 64-bit hardware should seriously consider using the 64-bit JDK, because it allows increased memory allocation and better performance. On the Sun site, you can ignore the notes in the 64-bit JDK about “Java Web Start” and “applets,” because Novell Teaming is neither of those.) Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable on your computer to the correct JDK path and name on your system. For example: On Linux: export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk_1.5.0_11 On Windows: JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_11 In Windows, you must set the JAVA_HOME environment variable. Also, close and re-open any command prompt windows after setting this variable. Install and Configure the Database Server. See . Download the appropriate Novell Teaming kit and unzip it. If you want to run the indexing service in Novell Teaming on a different machine from Novell Teaming, install the Lucene Index Server on the other machine. See . Run the installer from where you unzipped the Novell Teaming kit. See . The installer is named one of the following, according to your operating system: installer-liferay.exe installer-liferay.linux If you are doing an upgrade, use your existing license-key.xml and installer.xml files by placing them in the same directory as the installer program. If you are doing a new installation, use your license-key.xml by placing it in the same directory as the installer program. The license-key.xml file required to install the product is provided with the software kit (but is not included in the kit). Start and stop Novell Teaming. See . </content>

  <title>Database Planning</title>
  <url>../b9vchn7.html</url>
  <content>Database Planning Novell Teaming and Liferay* use separate dedicated databases within your database server. A set of SQL configuration scripts are used to initialize the databases (creating the necessary tables, etc.). Novell Teaming’s default database for Linux and Windows is MySQL. Novell Teaming also supports SQL Server on Windows, and Oracle on Linux and Windows. Novell Teaming’s database requirements are relatively modest. The bulk of the data uploaded to Novell Teaming is stored in a file repository (see ). The database is primarily used for storing metadata and descriptive text. Because the amount of data stored in the database is highly sensitive to the usage patterns of Novell Teaming (which are highly variable) there is no reliable formula for determining disk space usage, but the following can be used as a guideline: numberAttachments x averageAttachmentSize = totalAttachmentSpace totalAttachmentSpace * .04 = sqlDataSpace sqlDataSpace x 5 = sqlStorageSpace The installer generates your database scripts for you, but if your DBA wants to create the databases by hand, the necessary scripts are provided in the kit. See . See the following subsections: MySQL MySQL 5.0.26 (or higher) Server and Client for Linux or MySQL 5.0.26 (or higher) Server and Client for Windows are required with innodb support enabled. MySQL 5.1 is not yet supported. You can get the MySQL Community Server at: http://www.mysql.com/ . Specify root for the administrator password when you run the installer. The installer generates your database scripts for you, but if your DBA wants to create the databases by hand, the necessary scripts are provided in the kit. See . Set the default character set to UTF-8 by selecting Best support for Multilingualism in the Windows Configuration window, or edit the my.cnf configuration file to the following: [mysqld] character_set_server = utf8 [client] default_character_set = utf8 This file is usually located in /etc/my.cnf for Linux and in c:\my.cnf for Windows. See the MySQL documentation for details. Microsoft SQL Server You can use SQL Server 2000 or SQL Server 2005 Make sure to select SQL Server and Windows for authentication (the default is Windows only) Set the administrator password to sa when you run the installer. The installer generates your database scripts for you, but if your DBA wants to create the databases by hand, the necessary scripts are provided in the kit. See . Oracle Database Supported versions: Oracle 9, Oracle 10. Oracle’s default database name is orcl . We use this name in our examples. If you have chosen a different name, replace orcl with your database name. Novell Teaming is enabled for Unicode and requires you to set up the Oracle Database Character Set to support Unicode character encodings. Novell Teaming requires either the UTF8 or AL32UTF8 character set for proper operation. Oracle recommends the use of AL32UTF8, because it has increased support for certain Asian languages. Consult your Oracle documentation for the choice that makes sense for your database. To check your database character set, execute the following command with SQL*Plus: select value from SYS.NLS_DATABASE_PARAMETERS where PARAMETER = 'NLS_CHARACTERSET'; Before you install the Novell Teaming application software, run the two Oracle database scripts. These are provided in the kit: \database\oracle\create-database-oracle.sql \database\oracle\create-oracle.sql These two scripts need to be accessible to the SQL*Plus utility and your database, so copy them to a location on your system path. Edit the supplied database scripts to set the passwords for the users (these are defined in the top few lines of each script). For example, in create-database-oracle.sql , you see: drop user sitescape cascade; create user sitescape identified by sitescape; grant connect, resource to sitescape; connect sitescape/sitescape; user sitescape indicates that sitescape is the name of the database created. Do not change this. identified by sitescape declares that sitescape is the password for this database. Change this to the password you intend to use, such as identified by yourpassword and change the connect sitescape/sitescape to connect sitescape/ yourpassword . Use the SQL*Plus utility with the SYSTEM account to run the scripts: sqlplus SYSTEM/systemPassword @create-oracle.sql sqlplus SYSTEM/systemPassword @create-database-oracle.sql sqlplus&gt; quit Non-Local Database Setup When installing the Novell Teaming software for the first time, one of the steps involves creating two databases: one for the portal and one for the Novell Teaming application. If your DBA wants to create the databases by hand, the necessary scripts are provided in the kit. This is required for Oracle. For more information, see . The database scripts are in a database directory next to the installer: \database\mysql\create-database-mysql.sql \database\mysql\create-mysql.sql \database\sqlserver\create-database-sqlserver.sql \database\sqlserver\create-sql-server.sql \database\oracle\create-database-oracle.sql \database\oracle\create-oracle.sql When you run the installer, select the My DBA has already created the databases option in the Database selection window. </content>

  <title>File System Planning</title>
  <url>../b9vchn8.html</url>
  <content>File System Planning Novell Teaming software and configuration files are stored in a tree shared with Liferay, Tomcat, etc. There are some temporary files also located here, but it is used mainly for locks and similar files. Novell Teaming data is stored in the database (see ) and on the file system. The file system usage is divided up into several functional areas: filerepository : This is where all attachment files are located, so it is a large consumer of disk space. The tree is roughly organized by site, binder (folder/workspace), and entry. archiveStore : Only activated in the Enterprise version of Novell Teaming. This is where previous file versions are stored to meet compliance and archival goals. cachefilestore : This tree holds information derived from the attachments, such as thumbnails, scaled images, text, and HTML renderings. Depending on the nature of the attachments this tree consumes somewhat less space than the file repository (but it can, conceivably, store more). lucene : This tree holds the search index for the data. It tends to be a fraction of the space consumed by the file repository, but it is also sensitive to the type of information stored. Other trees: These are other trees that you cannot configure, which typically only consume a small amount of space. rss : Caches of RSS feeds for folders temp : Temporary files </content>

  <title>Network Planning</title>
  <url>../bbn8hra.html</url>
  <content>Network Planning Planning Firewalls, Ports, and Session Timeouts Novell Teaming is a complete Java/J2EE Web application and includes a Web server (Tomcat). Because the Web server listens on ports and processes network connections, you should consider the following as part of the installation process: Firewall Setup: The default installation uses port 8080/8443 for the Web server. Some local firewalls (such as the Windows Security Center’s firewall) might restrict traffic to port 8080/8443 and thus require proper configuration for access by other systems. If you can access Novell Teaming on the local server, but cannot access it from another system, examine your firewall settings. When utilizing an Oracle database, you may need to reconfigure Novell Teaming to run on port 8081. Port Conflicts: The Tomcat software uses a number of TCP/IP ports for both Web traffic and management messages. If you have other Web servers (Apache, IIS, or Tomcat) or other software installed that uses the same port numbers, your Novell Teaming software does not function properly. Novell Open Enterprise Server 2 (OES 2) systems have another Tomcat application running by default. The netstat -anp tcp command on Windows and the netstat -tan command on Linux can help find which ports are currently being used. For more information on network ports, consult your operating system networking guide. When you are in this situation, make sure that in addition to the http/https ports (8080/8443) you also assign free port numbers to the AJP Port and Shutdown Port settings in the Network information window when you run the installer. Port Mapping: For instances where the port number on which Tomcat listens for connections is different than what the end user sees in his or her browser, change the Listen Port and Secure listen Port settings to the local server ports and set the Port and Secure Port settings to the port numbers that the browsers are using in the Network information window when you run the installer. See and for details. The host, port, and securePort settings are used to generate URLs within the product and so must match what the user’s browser sees. Unless they are overridden by the Listen Port and Secure listen Port settings, the Port and Secure Port settings are used as the server’s listen ports. Liferay Session Timeout: You can configure Novell Teaming to log out of a session after a certain number of minutes. The default is 2 hours (240 minutes). You can change this by altering the Liferay session timeout setting in the Network information window when you run the installer. Port 80/443 configuration on Linux The default installation of Novell Teaming uses the Tomcat Web server. Although the Tomcat server is part of the Apache project, it is not the same thing as the Apache Web server. Tomcat is written in Java and can not perform some of the special privilege behaviors that Apache can. In particular, Linux does not allow non-root processes from allocating TCP/IP ports less than 1024. For this reason, the default configuration for Tomcat (and Novell Teaming) uses ports 8080 for http and 8443 for https (SSL). Unfortunately, this requires specifying the port number in the browser's URL for Novell Teaming (such as http://icecore.mycompany.com:8080). Although running Tomcat as root solves this problem, it creates many (far worse) problems. Do not run Tomcat as root . If you want Novell Teaming to be available on the default http/https ports, use an operating system feature called “kernel space port forwarding.” With this, the iptables command is used to map requests from port 80 to port 8080 (or whatever port you specify). For example: iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -d localhost -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8080 iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -d yourHostname -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8080 iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -d yourHostname -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8080 iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -d localhost -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8443 iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -d yourHostname -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8443 iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -d yourHostname -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8443 These changes only affect the running system. You need to add them to your startup sequence. See the *iptables* and *iptables_save* man pages for more information about setting up port forwarding. When you use this type of configuration, you must specify the ports the Tomcat server listens to and the ports that the browsers see in the Network information window when you run the installer. For example: Port = 80 Listen Port = 8080 Secure Port = 443 Secure listen Port = 8443 Integrating with iChain This feature is only available in the Enterprise version. Liferay/Novell Teaming contains support for single sign-on (SSO) based on iChain®. When Novell Teaming is running in this mode, the iChain server performs user authentication tasks and passes a token representing the authenticated user’s login name to Liferay/Novell Teaming in each request to indicate who made the request. You must configure Liferay/Novell Teaming with the same LDAP that iChain is using so that it can obtain and copy the user information into the portal. However, this configuration differs from the regular portal/LDAP integration in that no password checking is performed against LDAP when logging into the portal (because credential checking is only performed by the iChain server). This technique is safe only if all access to the portal is routed through the iChain proxy. The SSO configuration sets up a valve that only permits access from the local server and the iChain proxy server. For more information about Tomcat’s valve configuration, see tomcat.apache.org . You have to options available for WebDAV support: To use a two-accelerator configuration for WebDAV support, you must select the Use iChain proxy for WebDAV option and specify the iChain WebDAV accelerator in the iChain WebDAV Proxy field during installation. If you do not use a a two-accelerator configuration for WebDAV support, you must use basic authorization headers to support WebDAV. With basic authorization headers, the WebDAV URLs are made public with iChain and the authentication work is delegated to Novell Teaming, which stores the passwords locally so that the Teaming WebDAV server can use them for WebDAV client authentication. In this case, the value of iChain WebDAV Proxy field in the installer is ignored and Novell Teaming does not perform hostname re-write for the WebDAV URLs. See . To set up an iChain proxy: Assure that the iChain proxy’s host name and port number match the Novell Teaming/Liferay port number. If you have configured Novell Teaming to run on port 8080, the iChain proxy should also use port 8080. If the port numbers differ, you must set the Listen Port setting in the Network information window when you run the installer. For example, if iChain is set to provide access on the default ports (80/443) while Tomcat is listening on ports 8080/8443, use the following setting values in the Network information window when you run the installer: Host = your.server.host.name Port = 80 Listen Port = 8080 Secure Port = 443 Secure listen Port = 8443 If the iChain proxy and Novell Teaming host names/ports are not set up identically, you might experience page layout issues and other Novell Teaming features might not function properly. In iChain configuration window of the installer, select the Enable iChain option, set the Logoff URL setting to the log-off URL provided by the iChain proxy server, and set the iChain Proxy setting to the IP address of the iChain proxy server. Finish running the installer’s New Installation or Reconfiguration. See . After enabling the iChain SSO, log into Liferay by using a direct login URL: http://localhost:8080/c/portal/login and log in as admin . Because the SSO configuration removes the Sign In link, you must type the URL manually. If you have not already done so, use Liferay’s Admin portlet to enable LDAP-based authentication. This setup is necessary because Liferay has to copy user data from the LDAP into the portal database upon user login. To prevent users from logging into the portal directly through the portal’s login form, remove or rename the following file from Novell Teaming’s liferay-portal-tomcat directory: webapps/ROOT/html/portal/login.jsp You might also need to remove: work/Catalina/localhost/_/org/apache/jsp/html/portal/login_jsp.* Liferay/Novell Teaming is now ready to be put behind the proxy. Consult your iChain documentation on how to do this. To enable iChain integration-related debug log messages, modify Liferay’s portal-log4j-ext.xml to add the following category: &lt;category name="org.kablink.teaming.liferay.security.auth"&gt; &lt;priority value="DEBUG" /&gt; &lt;/category&gt; Use this only for testing or troubleshooting purposes. It is not recommended to have debug logging enabled on a production system. </content>

  <title>Memory Guidelines</title>
  <url>../b9vchnf.html</url>
  <content>Memory Guidelines Novell Teaming is a Java/J2EE application and therefore executes within a Java Virtual Machine (JVM*). The JVM exists as a process on your system and all of the Novell Teaming and portal software runs within it. Consequently, the amount of memory available to the JVM process is a critical aspect of overall Novell Teaming performance. The key JVM memory setting is the Java heap size, which roughly corresponds to the amount of memory available to the Java applications (such as Novell Teaming). The JVN heap size setting in the Java JDK location window of the installer allows you to set the amount of physical memory you want to devote to the Java Virtual Machine. The default configuration assumes that the JVM uses 1 GB (one gigabyte) of memory. It is possible to run Novell Teaming with less than 1 GB of assigned memory, but this is only applicable to very small test configurations, and is not suitable for production use. (In such a test configuration, 512 MB is the minimum amount of memory required to produce a functioning Novell Teaming application.) A general rule is that no more than 75% of the available physical memory should be allocated to the JVM. This means that you need to account for other processes (including the operating system itself) that use memory. Databases, in particular, tend to be memory-intensive, so take special care when co-locating a database server with the Novell Teaming application server. Java and Novell Teaming make heavy use of available memory to provide good performance. Larger deployments (large numbers of users and/or large numbers of documents) often need memory settings in excess of 2 GB to provide adequate performance. For these conditions, 64-bit hardware coupled with a 64-bit JVM are required. A JVM on a 32-bit system should never be configured to take more than 1.5 GB (1500 MB) of memory. Larger memory allocations require 64-bit servers. Novell Teaming memory usage is driven by a number of factors: Number of sessions (users logged in): Does not represent a significant amount of memory. Number of active/concurrent sessions: Does not represent a significant amount of memory. Novell Teaming internal database caches: Can be a significant fraction of memory use. These caches are separate from any caching or memory use by the database server itself, which might or might not be on the same server). Internal tuning settings have been set to handle a wide range of deployment sizes. Lucene index cache: Can also be a significant consumer of memory. Large data stores (particularly with large files or a high number of files) can create a very large index. Installations with this type of demand should consider separating the Lucene Index Server to a dedicated standalone server for optimum performance (see ). </content>

  <title>Security Guidelines</title>
  <url>../bbn5klr.html</url>
  <content>Security Guidelines Liferay Session Timeout: The default session timeout is 2 hours (240 minutes). You can lengthen or shorten this by changing the Liferay session timeout setting in the Network information window of the installer. Role-Based Access Control: Novell Teaming controls all access to folders and entries by using role-based access controls. See “Adjusting Access Control for the Site” in the Novell Teaming Administration Guide to learn more about the default roles and access settings. Keep in mind that Novell Teaming is intended to be used primarily for the sharing of information, so many default access rights lean toward allowing at least universal read access. Inbound E-mail: You can configure Novell Teaming to read e-mail and post those e-mail messages as entries in a folder. Because e-mail is inherently insecure, there is no way to be sure that the sender is who they claim to be. Novell Teaming marks the entries posted by e-mail to alert users about their origin. Web Services are enabled by default: The default Novell Teaming installation allows authenticated access via Web services. If you are not using Web services, you can disable them by deselecting the Enable Web Services option in the Network information window of the installer. WebDAV Authentication: Authenticated access via WebDAV is via the Basic Authentication mechanism. Because of the weaknesses of Basic Authentication, secure (SSL) connections are recommended. RSS feed URLs: Because RSS readers are outside of the authentication system, the URL provided by Novell Teaming for an RSS feed embeds some authentication information about the user. This means that the RSS URL must be protected and not shared between users. For this reason, RSS is not recommended for use on highly sensitive data. To disable RSS feeds, deselect the Enable RSS option in the RSS configuration window of the installer during initial installation, or run a reconfiguration with the installer to disable RSS feeds after installation. LDAP (directory service) Proxy User: You can configure Novell Teaming (and the portal) to utilize information in the LDAP directory service to provide basic user account information (and group memberships). Access to the LDAP server is done via a configuration page that requires you to specify a username and password for access to the LDAP directory. This user should be created in the LDAP directory service with the minimum number of privileges needed to perform the job. In particular, all LDAP synchronization activities are one-way, so the proxy user only requires read access to the directory. We highly advise that you configure LDAP with a secure SSL connection. LDAP Directory access is unencrypted by default: See “Secure LDAP/eDirectory Setup” in the Novell Teaming Administration Guide for information about configuring Novell Teaming to use SSL when communicating with the LDAP directory. File System Repositories contains unencrypted data: See for details about how Novell Teaming uses the local file system for data storage. These directories contain uploaded information in various formats (both native file formats and potentially a number of rendered formats (such as cached HTML versions of files, thumbnails, and RSS feeds) as well as archived data. These files are managed exclusively by the Novell Teaming application software and the file system protections should be set to protect those directories from unauthorized access. Database access is unencrypted by default: Depending on your local security guidelines, you might want to encrypt the database connections between the Novell Teaming and Portal software and their respective databases. SSL encrypted data between the applications and database servers imposes a performance penalty because of the increased overhead of encrypting and decrypting the retrieved data. Support for this is highly dependent on the database client drivers and JDBC connector support and how you are configuring your client and server certificates. You should check with the database vendors on how to set up SSL connections on both the client and server sides of the connection. You need to at least update the JDBC URL selections in the Database selection window of the installer. For example, for MySQL you might add useSSL=true&amp;requireSSL=true to the options part of the URL. Mirrored Folder Proxy User: See “Configuring Mirrored Folders” in the Novell Teaming Administration Guide for more information about the mirrored folder feature of the Enterprise version of Novell Teaming. You can configure Novell Teaming to use server directories (either in the local file system or via file sharing) as repositories for Novell Teaming folders. Because the Novell Teaming application server is accessing those directories, the user ID that the application server runs as acts as a proxy user for all file system access (that is, the file system only sees one user accessing the files on behalf of all Novell Teaming users who have access to the Novell Teaming folder). This proxy user should be used to configure any local file system access (or shared file access) appropriately. If you configure a mirrored folder to a WebDAV or Microsoft SharePoint* directory, the resource driver is configured to use a proxy username and password. The same access control practices should be applied to these resources as are used with the file system resource driver. Conferencing account password is stored in configuration file: If you are using Conferencing, the password to a Conferencing account is stored in: WEB-INF/classes/config/ssf.properties Password Storage in the Server File System: A number of application accounts and passwords are stored in the file system. These files should be protected against unauthorized access on the server. The installer.xml file contains a majority of the account and password information. You should protect this file accordingly. The installer’s Reconfigure option uses this information to create and update a number of configuration files within the application software directory tree. These files are outlined below: Database user IDs and passwords for the portal and Novell Teaming software are stored in XML files in the following directories: conf/Catalina/localhost/ssf.xml (Novell Teaming) conf/Catalina/localhost/ROOT.xml (Liferay Portal) Mirrored folder resource drivers to WebDAV/Sharepoint shares store the proxy user and passwords in: WEB-INF/classes/config/ssf.properties The e-mail access (both inbound and outbound) might contain usernames and passwords for authentication (such as, authenticated SMTP). These are stored in: conf/Catalina/localhost/ssf.xml (Novell Teaming) conf/Catalina/localhost/ROOT.xml (Liferay Portal) Some application accounts and passwords are stored in the database. These are protected by application access controls, but are available if access to the database is obtained through other means, such as an LDAP proxy user and password. </content>

  <title>Load-Balancing and Clustering Novell Teaming</title>
  <url>../bbnqb4c.html</url>
  <content>Load-Balancing and Clustering Novell Teaming In this release, Novell Teaming does not support session replication across cluster nodes. If you have more than one clustered installation of Novell Teaming in your network, each cluster group needs a unique multicast group IP address to prevent them from interfering with each other. To set up a scalable, clustered Novell Teaming configuration, use the following steps as a guideline: Set up a shared file storage that is accessible to all nodes. Novell Teaming’s Simple File Repository is safe for use in a clustered environment with shared storage that is accessible to all nodes. Setting up shared storage is a platform-specific task. Install and configure the Lucene Index Server. See for how to place the Lucene Index Server on a dedicated server system. All cluster nodes share this index server. Make sure that the time is the same on all nodes in the cluster (using synchronized time services for your cluster is highly advised). Install the Novell Teaming/portal bundle kit on each cluster node. Because all the nodes share the same database server, it is important not to execute the database-initialization SQL scripts more than once (that is, use the installer’s Reconfigure option rather than the New installation option on all but the first cluster node). Each node in the cluster can use the same installer.xml file (generated by the installer during initial installation). This assures that cluster nodes are configured uniformly. The following settings must be uniform across the cluster: Configure the database connection settings on each node to use the same database. Set the file system settings to all point to the same shared file storage server. Set the Network settings (name, port, etc.) to the name of the LOAD BALANCER system. In the Lucene configuration window of the installer, select server in the Lucene configuration type drop-down list and set the Host selection to the hostname of the machine on which you installed the Lucene Index Server. See . Set the portal up to work in a clustered environment. If you need to set more advanced configurations, use cache.cluster.properties instead of cache.cluster.multicast.ip in the steps below. For more information, refer to Liferay's documentation at wiki.liferay.com and http://wiki.liferay.com . Liferay provides additional high availability information at wiki.liferay.com . Edit the /webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/classes/portal-ext.properties file by uncommenting the following two lines: cache.event.listeners=com.opensymphony.oscache.plugins.clustersupport.JavaGroupsBroadcastingListener cache.cluster.multicast.ip=231.12.21.100 Edit the /webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/classes/cache-multi-vm-ext.properties file by uncommenting the following two lines: cache.event.listeners=com.opensymphony.oscache.plugins.clustersupport.JavaGroupsBroadcastingListener cache.cluster.multicast.ip=231.12.21.101 Configure the load balancer. There are a variety of load balancing solutions that work with J2EE deployments. The following example configuration uses the balancer module built into the newer Apache (version 2.2.4), and is based on a widely used sticky session technique. Novell Teaming does not support session sharing/replication among Tomcat instances. Edit Tomcat’s server.xml . Add jvmRoute="jvm&lt;n&gt;" to the &lt;Engine name="Catalina" ...&gt; element, where &lt;n&gt; should be an integer unique to each Tomcat instance. For example, assuming you have two Tomcat instances in a cluster, the Catalina engine element should look like the following in each server.xml respectively ( jvm&lt;n&gt; is the name of the worker as declared in the load balancer): &lt;Engine name="Catalina" defaultHost="localhost" jvmRoute="jvm1"&gt; &lt;Engine name="Catalina" defaultHost="localhost" jvmRoute="jvm2"&gt; Edit Apache’s httpd.conf file (in the &lt;apache installation&gt;/conf directory). Uncomment the following three lines: LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so LoadModule proxy_ajp_module modules/mod_proxy_ajp.so LoadModule proxy_balancer_module modules/mod_proxy_balancer.so Append the following section to the end of the file: &lt;Location /balancer-manager&gt; SetHandler balancer-manager Order deny,allow Deny from all Allow from 127.0.0.1 &lt;/Location&gt; &lt;Proxy balancer://aspenCluster&gt; BalancerMember ajp://&lt;tomcat host name 1&gt;:8009 route=jvm1 BalancerMember ajp://&lt;tomcat host name 2&gt;:8009 route=jvm2 &lt;/Proxy&gt; &lt;Location /&gt; ProxyPass balancer://aspenCluster/ stickysession=JSESSIONID &lt;/Location&gt; Substitute the real Tomcat hostnames for &lt;tomcat host name 1&gt; and &lt;tomcat host name 2&gt; . If you have more than two Tomcat instances in the cluster, make an additional line for each. Configure Hibernate second-level cache to use cluster-safe distributed cache. To do this, rename the ehcache-hibernate.xml file in the webapps/ssf/WEB-INF/classes/config directory to something else, say, ehcache-hibernate-non-clustered.xml . Then, rename the ehcache-hibernate-clustered.xml file in the same directory to ehcache-hibernate.xml . Start the Lucene Index Server, and then start the application cluster nodes. </content>

  <title>Running the Installer</title>
  <url>../installer.html</url>
  <content>Running the Installer If you are doing an upgrade, use your existing license-key.xml and installer.xml files by placing them in the same directory as the installer program (the unzipped Novell Teaming kit). If you are doing a new installation, use your license-key.xml by placing it in the same directory as the installer program. The license-key.xml file required to install the product is provided with the software kit (but is not included in the kit). You can edit the installer.xml file directly and run the installer’s Reconfigure option to reconfigure Novell Teaming. See . Run the installer (on Linux, do a chmod +x installer-liferay.linux to make the installer executable). The installer is named one of the following according to your operating system: installer-liferay.exe installer-liferay.linux On Linux, you can run a console-based version of the installer (has all the same options as the GUI-based installer) using the following command: installer-liferay.linux -console In the Welcome window, select the procedure you want to perform, then click Next : New installation Use this option to perform an initial installation of Novell Teaming. The rest of this procedure walks you through an advanced initial installation to show you all the available options. Upgrade Use this option to perform an upgrade of an existing Novell Teaming application. Reconfigure Use this option to reconfigure an existing Novell Teaming application. Read the license agreement, select the I accept the license agreement option to indicate your acceptance of this agreement, then click Next . In the Choose installation type window, select the type of installation you want to perform, then click Next : Basic : Use this option if you are do not need to configure any optional features. Advanced : Use this option if you need to configure any of the optional features. In the Install location window, use the associated Browse buttons to change the default location for the installation or file system: If you need to change the locations of any of the file system components, select advanced from the File system setup type drop-down list to activate the Browse buttons for these components, make the necessary changes, then click Next . In the Liferay data location window, click Browse if you need to change the default Root location for this data, then click Next . In the Network information window, specify the network values for how you want Novell Teaming to appear on the network. See . In the Database selection window, configure your databases and select whether or not to create the databases during install. The database server you select must already be installed. If your DBA created the databases by hand (required for Oracle), select the My DBA has already created the databases option. For more information, see . To configure your databases: Select the database from the Database type drop-down list. Enter your Username , Password , and JDBC URL for the icecore and Liferay databases, then click Next . In the Java JDK location window, click Browse to select the Java Home directory location (if not detected automatically), type in the JVM heap size value if you require more than the default 1 G (use a small “g” with no spaces), then click Next . In the Lucene configuration window, edit the fields to configure the Lucene index. To run the Lucene index as a server, select server from the Lucene configuration type drop-down list, type in the Host , and edit RMI Port value if the default port cannot be used. You can run the Lucene as a server from the same system as Novell Teaming or from a remote system. You need to install the Standalone Lucene Index Server before running Novell Teaming. See . In the RSS configuration window, edit the fields to configure the Novell Teaming RSS feeds, or deselect the Enable RSS option to disable RSS feeds, then click Next . RSS feed URLs: Because RSS readers are outside of the authentication system, the URL provided by Novell Teaming for an RSS feed embeds some authentication information about the user. This means that the RSS URL must be protected and not shared between users. For this reason, RSS is not recommended for use on highly sensitive data. In the Outbound email configuration window, edit the fields to configure your outbound e-mail settings. Outbound configuration requires the basic information for generating SMTP mail messages: server, port, and optional authentication information. The Username field is the address used for any e-mail notifications generated by the system. This name is also used for authenticated access to the SMTP server. To support e-mail sent by users, either the Novell Teaming server or the authenticated user must be authorized to use different From addresses. For more information, see the “Mail Setup” section of the Novell Teaming Administration Guide . In the Inbound email configuration window, edit the following fields to configure your inbound e-mail settings, then click Next . For inbound mail (postings) you need to specify either pop3 or imap ( pop3s or imaps for SSL connections to mail servers) from the Email protocol drop-down list. These settings are not used until you enable incoming e-mail in Novell Teaming. Novell Teaming posting uses real or alias e-mail addresses in your folders, according to whether you select the Use aliases option: When you use aliases for posting, the system accesses a single e-mail account (posting account). Novell Teaming routes e-mail from this account to individual folders based on unique e-mail addresses (aliases) which are assigned to individual folders and mapped to the posting account. When you use real e-mail addresses for each folder, you need to create multiple posting accounts using your normal e-mail system management tools. Each posting e-mail address is used for a single folder. Create the posting accounts using your normal e-mail system management tools. Novell Teaming needs a host, port, e-mail account ID, and password for the posting feature to work. In the Presence configuration window, select the Enable presence option to link your Novell Teaming and Conferencing servers together. You need to obtain the values for the following fields from an installed and configured Conferencing server. If you do not know these values now, you can run the installer’s Reconfigure option to add this information later. Click Next to continue. In the iChain configuration window, select Enable iChain to use the iChain Single Sign-on Support (SSO), set the Logoff URL to the address used to trigger an iChain logoff, set the IP address of the iChain Proxy server. Only transactions from that address and the localhost are allowed. For more information, see . You have to options available for WebDAV support: To use a two-accelerator configuration for WebDAV support, you must select the Use iChain proxy for WebDAV option and specify the iChain WebDAV accelerator in the iChain WebDAV Proxy field during installation. If you do not use a a two-accelerator configuration for WebDAV support, you must use basic authorization headers to support WebDAV. With basic authorization headers, the WebDAV URLs are made public with iChain and the authentication work is delegated to Novell Teaming, which stores the passwords locally so that the Teaming WebDAV server can use them for WebDAV client authentication. In this case, the value of iChain WebDAV Proxy field in the installer is ignored and Novell Teaming does not perform hostname re-write for the WebDAV URLs. For more information, see . Click Next to continue. Mirrored folders are local/shared directories that are exposed within Novell Teaming. You must configure the directories here before they are available in Novell Teaming. For security reasons the set of people who can map Novell Teaming folders to these shared directories should be limited. There are three mirrored folder types: file - for normal file systems webdav - for WebDAV servers that support basic authentication sharepoint - for Microsoft Sharepoint WebDAV access Mirrored Folders are available only in the Enterprise Edition. A mirrored folder is a Novell Teaming folder that uses a server file system directory as its file storage area instead of the normal Novell Teaming repository. Typically the directory is a file share, accessed via normal file sharing mechanisms. Novell Teaming attempts to keep its knowledge about the folder contents in sync with whatever is in the directory. Because of the way mirrored folders are configured, they are intended to bring common (relatively static) file shares into the Novell Teaming environment. They are not appropriate for individual file shares. You can use Novell Teaming to add additional metadata around these files, including Novell Teaming-specific access controls. The following fields specify the mirrored folder resource drivers. These drivers then make the files in the specified directory available to the Novell Teaming folders. It is important to note that the Novell Teaming process accesses the directories and that the user ID for Novell Teaming acts as a proxy for all Novell Teaming users. If you need more than three mirrored folders, you need to edit the installer.xml file directly and run the installer’s Reconfigure option. For more information, see the “Configuring Mirrored Folders” section in the Novell Teaming Administration Guide. Click Next to continue. In the Ready to install window, click Next to begin the installation or use the Back button to review the current configuration of the installer. </content>

  <title>Installing a Standalone Lucene Index Server</title>
  <url>../bbijvt7.html</url>
  <content>Installing a Standalone Lucene Index Server This section covers how to install the Lucene Index Server as a standalone server. You need to install JDK (Sun JDK 1.5.0_011 or higher) before installing the Lucene Index Server. Linux systems need to have a minimum open file limit of 4096. To install a Standalone Lucene Index Server for a new Novell Teaming application: Copy the Lucene installer to the system on which you want to install the standalone Lucene Index Server. The Lucene installers are in the Novell Teaming kit you unzipped: lucene-installer.exe lucene-installer.linux Run the Lucene installer. In the Welcome window, select the procedure you want to perform, then click Next : New installation Use this option to perform an initial installation of the Standalone Lucene Index Server. Upgrade Use this option to perform an upgrade of an existing Standalone Lucene Index Server. Reconfigure Use this option to reconfigure an existing Standalone Lucene Index Server. Read the license agreement, select the I accept the license agreement option to indicate your acceptance of this agreement, then click Next . In the Install location window, click Browse if you need to change the default Install location for the luceneserver , then click Next . In the Lucene configuration window, edit the fields to configure the Lucene index. Type in the Host , and edit RMI Port value if the default port cannot be used. Click Next to continue. You can run the Lucene as a server from the same system as Novell Teaming or from a remote system. You need to install the Standalone Lucene Index Server before running Novell Teaming. See . In the Ready to install window, click Next to begin the installation or use the Back button to review the current configuration of the installer. To install a Standalone Lucene Index Server for an Existing Novell Teaming Application: Shut down Novell Teaming on the Novell Teaming server (see ). Run the Lucene installer (see above procedure). On the standalone server, check the lucene-server.properties file and find the setting for index.root.dir (you can edit this setting to change the location of the root directory). Create a liferay.com subdirectory in the index.root.dir directory. On the Novell Teaming server, look at the ssf.properties file and find the data.root.dir setting. Copy all the files from the data.root.dir /lucene/liferay.com directory on the Novell Teaming server to the index.root.dir /liferay.com directory you just created on the standalone machine. If you are using FTP, make sure to copy in binary mode. For UNIX systems, make sure permissions are set so that the Novell Teaming user has full access to these files and the liferay.com directory. Start the server at the end of the installation (if it is not already started): Change directories to lucene-server-installation-dir Run the rmiregistry-startup script in the bin directory Run the indexserver-startup script in the bin directory Restart Novell Teaming (see ). </content>

  <title>Starting and Stopping Novell Teaming</title>
  <url>../b9vchnb.html</url>
  <content>Starting and Stopping Novell Teaming Starting Novell Teaming/Liferay These are Liferay-only instructions. On Windows: From the command prompt, change directories to the Liferay bin directory, and then run the startup command: &gt; cd C:\yourinstall\liferay-portal-tomcat-5.5-jdk5-4.3.0\bin\ &gt; startup.bat On Windows, you need to run the startup.bat command from the bin directory. On Linux: /yourinstall/liferay-portal-tomcat-5.5-jdk5-4.3.0/bin/icecore start Depending on your system configuration, it can take more than of 60 seconds before Novell Teaming/Liferay starts accepting Web transactions. Initial transactions also tend to be slower as various caches load into RAM. These delays are amplified somewhat when working with a new installation or updated software because the JSPs are recompiled as they are referenced. In Windows, startup is complete when the Tomcat window displays the following message: INFO:Server Startup in ##### ms In Linux, the system does not automatically open a monitor window. You can start one by navigating to your your-installation /life-ray-portal-tomcat-5.5-jdk-4.30/logs directory and executing tail --f catalina.out . Startup is complete when this window displays: INFO:Server Startup in ##### ms Setting up Novell Teaming to Start on System Startup On Windows: Enter C:\yourinstall\liferay-portal-tomcat-5.5-jdk5-4.3.0\bin\service.bat install icecore Use the Services Control Panel to configure the service to your needs. Select Control Panel &gt; Administration Tools &gt; Services . Right-click the ApacheTomcat icecore service and select Properties . Change the Startup Type to Automatic and click OK . Set your firewall to allow port 8080. On Linux, from the root account: Enter cp /yourinstall/liferay-portal-tomcat-5.5-jdk5-4.3.0/bin/icecore /etc/init.d Enter chkconfig --add icecore Log Files and Monitoring On Windows: A Tomcat window appears when you issue the startup.bat command.

  <title>Novell Teaming Backup and Restore Procedures</title>
  <url>../bcghun2.html</url>
  <content>Novell Teaming Backup and Restore Procedures If your system has a period of minimal activity (such as at 1:00 AM) you can do the backups without taking the system offline. If you perform this step every night, it is usually possible to restore without problems. The worst case scenario would be that the Lucene directory was caught adding an entry when the snapshot was taken. This can be remedied by re-building the search index from the Teaming Administration portlet. Method 1: Take the system down on a scheduled basis. During the down period: Take a snapshot of the database Make a backup copy of the Lucene index, default location is: /opt/icecore/luceneserver/liferay.com Make a backup of the file repositories that are in use, for example: /home/icecoredata/filerepository Restart your ICEcore system. This approach is the most conservative. It guarantees a consistent snapshot of your whole system. However, doing a backup of the file repository can take a long time depending on your backup approach. Method 2: Take the system down on a scheduled basis. During the down period: Take a snapshot of the database Make a backup copy of the Lucene index Bring the system back online. After the system is running again, start the backup of the file repositories. This approach minimizes the down time. However, it is possible that during a restore after a catastrophic failure the files may be out of synchronization with the metadata. This does cause any problems when running the system, but users may find that slightly newer versions of the files exist in the restored system than were present at the time of the database snapshot. This is usually a good thing. </content>
