   <para>In the upper-left corner of the page, a SiteScape Forum Manager link appears. This is the name associated with the default management account (wf_admin). When the name appears in the upper-left corner, you are logged into the system. (You can change the name "SiteScape Forum Manager" by modifying the user profile for the wf_admin account.)</para>
   <para>When you begin managing Forum, there are only two management levels: site managers (who manage the server machine) and zone managers. </para>
   <para>By default, wf_admin is the only member of the Administrators group for the initial zone; if you create an additional zone, then the zone creator and wf_admin are both members of the Administrators group. Members of the Administrators group have the right to perform zone-management tasks. If you choose, you can add other members to this group, so that they can help manage the zone.</para>

  <sect2 id="b9vdhwi">
   <title>Management Levels</title>
   <para>Although it is possible have members of the Administrators group manage everything, this strategy becomes problematic as you create more workspaces and forums. At that point, it is helpful to delegate workspace management and the management of individual resources.</para>
   <para>The Forum management levels and the default tasks that managers at those levels may perform are:</para>
   <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="normal">
    <listitem>
     <para>Site Managers</para>
     <para>Primarily responsible for working with the SiteScape Forum software so that Forum runs smoothly. Tasks include updating the installation on the server, troubleshooting the internal processes of Forum, enabling e-mail for the system, and so on.</para>
     <para>Because site managers work directly with the server, there is no management menu specifically designed for them. Usually, site managers are also zone managers.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>Zone Managers</para>
     <para>Primarily responsible for performing the initial setup of the zone managing users and groups, creating workspaces, delegating management, customizing the zone using templates, and assisting the discussion-forum managers with the creation of initial custom commands and workflow processes.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>Workspace Managers</para>
     <para>Responsible for creating and deleting forums in a workspace, determining which forums appear in the workspace, viewing auditing information about the workspace, customizing the workspace using templates, and creating or deleting additional workspaces. </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>Forum Managers</para>
     <para>Responsible for managing a single forum. The responsibilities vary according to the type of forum being managed (discussion, calendar, tasks, and so on). Forum managers can modify access controls for the forum and allow or prevent viewing, participation, and other actions.</para>
     <para>Managing a discussion forum requires more effort than managing other kinds of forums. These managers are responsible for auditing activity, deleting or moving entries, defining global keywords for users, managing the schedule for e-mail notifications, defining new commands and workflow processes, adding or removing columns in the list of entries, customizing the forum using templates, running reports about content in the discussion forum, and managing the e-mail posting of forum entries.</para>
