<p class="para">The panel in the upper left corner of the page is called the Help Mode Control Panel. Most often, you use it to access the table of contents or the getting started PDF manuals. To minimize the Help Mode Control Panel, click the Minimize icon<img src="images/minimize_icon_n.png" alt="" class="inline" />, located at the top of the control panel. Click this icon again to restore the panel to its full size.
  </p>
<p class="para">Help mode describes the page you are currently viewing. Click an <span class="guimenu">Information</span> icon<img src="images/helpicon_n.png" alt="" class="inline" />, and <span class="phrase">Kablink</span> Teaming displays a Help panel describing that section of the page. To close the help panel, click the <span class="guimenu">Close</span> icon (X) in the upper right corner of the Help panel. Or, you can click another <span class="guimenu">Information</span> icon to keep reading. Instead of using Information icons, you can click <span class="guimenu">Help topics</span> in the Help Mode Control Panel, and click the linked titles of topics that interest you.
  </p>
<p class="para">For more complete Teaming documentation, you can click <span class="guimenu">View manuals</span> in the Help Mode Control Panel. </p>
<p class="para">When finished using the Help mode, you can exit by clicking the <span class="guimenu">Close</span> icon (X) in the upper right corner of the control panel, or you can click anywhere on the dimmed part of the page.</p>
<p class="para">After you exit Help mode and begin using tools, Teaming provides Information icons<img src="images/helpicon_n.png" alt="" class="inline" /> on forms that require additional explanation. Click the Information icon next to a form section to read more about it.
