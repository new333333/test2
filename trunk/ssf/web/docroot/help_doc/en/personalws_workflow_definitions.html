<p class="para">A workflow state is a label that identifies the result of a completed task and indicates who is responsible for performing a subsequent task (if any). A state transition occurs when one or more discrete conditions are met. Depending on conditions that are met, a state can transition to one of potentially many subsequent states.</p>
<p class="para">Access control identifies which users have the right to perform specific tasks at each state within the workflow process.</p>
<p class="para">A workflow question allows the workflow process to use a set of answers by users to determine whether and how an entry should transition. This feature is available only with the purchase of Advanced Workflow.</p>
<p class="para">A notification is an e-mail message sent to a set of people (specified in the access control settings) upon state transition.</p>
<p class="para">A parallel thread* is a somewhat independent sub-process of the workflow, whose transitions proceed at the same time as those of the main workflow. A state in the main workflow initiates the parallel thread, and another state further along waits for one or more parallel processes to end before transitions in the main workflow continue. This feature is available only with the purchase of Advanced Workflow.</p>
<p class="para">A dedicated application is a folder whose only entry type is potentially custom designed and associated with a workflow process. This folder has only one type of entry, and the work is highly focused.</p>
