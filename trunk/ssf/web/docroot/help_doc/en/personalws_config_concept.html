<h1 class="title"> Conceptual Overview</h1>

<p class="para">To configure <span class="phrase">Kablink</span> Teaming, it is helpful to understand the design that supports objects in the user interface. Generally, there are workspaces and folders (places), and entries (things). Furthermore, there are personal workspaces and profiles of contact information (people), and files attached to entries (also things).</p>
<p class="para">To support a specific collaboration purpose, each category can have subcategories. For example, a folder can be a discussion, blog, wiki, file, photo album, guestbook, and so on.</p>
<p class="para">A definition is a set of elements that affect the content and appearance of an object subcategory. Continuing the folder example, the wiki definition establishes both the form used to create a wiki folder (called the form) and content users see when displaying a wiki folder (called the view). </p>
<p class="para">Finally, consider the difference between a category (such as, a wiki folder) and a created object that belongs to that category (such as, â€œAcme company policies and procedures wikiâ€?). When you direct Teaming to create an instance of an object, it requires a set of default configuration settings to apply to the newly created object.</p>
<p class="para">A template is the set of default configuration settings used to create a new place (workspace or folder). A template includes a definition (the form and view used to create and display the object), default access control settings (usually set to â€œinherit from parentâ€?), and often much more. For example, templates for folders include default entry types (wiki folders should contain wiki entries), a list of allowable views (possibly presenting wiki data in a discussion table, or listed by time like a calendar), a default view (wiki folders should default to a wiki folder display), and more.</p>
