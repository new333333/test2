<h1 class="title"> Understanding <span class="phrase">Kablink Teaming</span> Teams</h1>

<p class="para">Generally, a team is a group of people working together to achieve a shared goal. <span class="phrase">Kablink Teaming</span> teams provide you with a dedicated area in which to collaborate online, and in which to communicate quickly and easily with teammates.</p>
<p class="para">By default, all people using <span class="phrase">Kablink Teaming</span> can create a team workspace, which provides your team with a dedicated work area. After you create your team workspace, add as many sub-workspaces or folders (discussions, file libraries, wikis, blogs, and so on) as you need for your work.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="phrase">Kablink Teaming</span> supports a second type of team that can be applied to any workspace or folder. One reason why this team is useful is because it is a quick way to allow a group of people to participate in a place (for example, adding people to a team in a personal folder allows those people to author new entries). Another application is to designate a group of people as serving in a special role in that place (for example, subject-matter experts or moderators). To create teams of this type, the owner of a workspace or folder can use the Team &gt; Add or delete team members menu item to create that team and can use access control settings to grant additional privileges. </p>
<p class="para"><span class="phrase">Kablink Teaming</span> communication tools allow for quicker use among team members. For example, in a team workspace, if you click the Meet link at the bottom of a workspace or folder, click Team members, and click Start meeting now, then <span class="phrase">Kablink Teaming</span> initiates an online meeting, using SiteScape ICEcore Conference, without you having to specify team names individually. Membership in a team also facilitates use of the clipboard, IM using SiteScape ICEcore Conference, and e-mail.</p>
<p class="para">Membership in a team can determine who can view or participate in a workspace or folder. Also, membership in a team can quicken the speed of configuration and communication. For example, while working in a team area, you can add all members of a team quickly to a buddy list or to the clipboard.</p>
