<h1 class="title"> Associating Workflow Processes</h1>

<p class="para">When you use the Workflow designer in the administrative portlet, the process is independent from any particular entry or folder. To test and use your workflow process, you can configure the folder to allow the use of the workflow in the folder. This means that you can view an entry and can use a menu item in the toolbar to start the process for that one entry.</p>
<p class="para">Most production-ready systems require that a workflow process start automatically when a user creates an entry. To enable this, you can associate the workflow with a particular type of entry, as follows:</p>
<div class="procedure">
<ol class="steps">
<li class="step" id="bi0novw">
<p class="para">Select the folder that is to contain entries associated with the workflow process.</p></li>
<li class="step" id="bi0noxj">
<p class="para">Click <span class="guimenu">Manage this folder</span> &gt; <span class="guimenu">Configure</span>. </p>
<p class="para">In the <span class="guimenu">Workflow associations</span> section of the form, <span class="phrase">Kablink</span> Teaming lists default entry types next to drop-down lists.</p></li>
<li class="step" id="bi0np9p">
<p class="para">Select an entry type with which you want to associate a workflow process.</p></li>
<li class="step" id="bi0npbe">
<p class="para">In the drop-down list, select the name of the workflow process you want to associate with the default entry type.</p></li>
<li class="step" id="bi0npd4">
<p class="para">Click <span class="guimenu">Apply</span>.</p></li></ol>
</div>

<p class="para">Now, when someone creates an entry of that type in this folder, Teaming automatically places the entry in the initial state of the workflow process.</p>
