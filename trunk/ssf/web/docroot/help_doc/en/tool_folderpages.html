<p class="para">These tools enable you to search for entries individually, or navigate among pages of listings. A folder listing displays entries or information about entries. Some of these tools are useful only if there is more than one listing page of entries. From left to right on this toolbar, the available tools are:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="listbullet">
<li class="listitem">
<div class="formalpara" id="bi6bwta">
            <p class="title"><em class="title">Go to this Entry:</em>
            Specify the number (displayed in the <span class="guimenu">#</span> column) of the entry that you want to view, then click <span class="guimenu">Go</span>.</p>
          </div>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<div class="formalpara" id="bi6bwtb">
            <p class="title"><em class="title">Previous/Next:</em>
            These buttons enable you to scroll through the pages of the folder.</p>
          </div>

<li class="listitem">
<div class="formalpara" id="bi6bwtc">
            <p class="title"><em class="title">Go to page:</em>
            When you type a page number in this text box and then click <span class="guimenu">Go</span>, <span class="phrase">Kablink</span> Teaming displays the entries on that listing page. </p>
