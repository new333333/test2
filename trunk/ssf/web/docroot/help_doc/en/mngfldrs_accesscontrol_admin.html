<h1 class="title"> Delegating Administration</h1>

<p class="para">As the number of global workspaces and folders grow, it becomes impractical to have the same people manage all places in the workspace hierarchy. For this reason, you can delegate the administration of workspaces or folders.</p>
<p class="para">Generally, create a group with the names of the people to whom you would like to delegate workspace or folder management (if there is more than one person). Add the group to the access control table using the Add group link (on the left side of the table). <span class="phrase">Kablink Teaming</span> adds a row for the newly added group or user. Finally, select a check box in the Workspace and folder administration column.</p>
<p class="para">It is possible that you want to limit the privileges that you assign to the administrators of a workspace or folder. (For example, you might not want them to be able to delete the place.) In this case, you might want to create a new role (for example, Moderator), which includes only some of the rights granted to someone in the Workspace and folder administration role.</p>
