<h1 class="title"> Workflow Overview</h1>

<p class="para">All organizations develop business processes, which establish a structured set of tasks that achieve a specific goal, such as ordering office supplies, hiring new employees, requesting paid time off, and getting expense reimbursements.</p>
<p class="para">Tasks in a business process can be independent or dependent upon other tasks. An example of a dependent task is one that requires management approval. Also, tasks can be performed by members of your organization or can be performed automatically (for example, an expiration date).</p>
<p class="para">Before, during, or after task completion, someone might report the status of the work, and the status determines who must work on the item next. Examples of status labels include Begun, Assigned, On Hold, Needing Approval, Completed, and so on. </p>
<p class="para">A workflow process is an online version of a business process. A workflow process enables people to automate, record the history of, and track all aspects of the business process. To create a workflow process, use the Workflow designer in the administration portlet, then use the <span class="phrase">Kablink</span> Teaming configuration tools to either have the process start automatically when a user creates such an entry (called workflow association) or to allow users to start the process manually when viewing any type of entry (using the Entry toolbar).</p>
