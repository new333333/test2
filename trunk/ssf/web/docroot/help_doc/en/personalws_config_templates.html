<h1 class="title"> Using Templates</h1>

<p class="para">If you are a site administrator, you can use the Workspaces and Folder Templates tool. You can alter default templates or create new ones.</p>
<p class="para">To access the Workspaces and Folder Templates tool, click <span class="guimenu">Manage</span> &gt; <span class="guimenu">Site Administration</span>, then click <span class="guimenu">Manage Workspace and Folder Templates</span>.</p>
<p class="para">The default templates establish configuration settings for a single workspace or folder. From the perspective of the Workspace tree, the default templates configure a flat hierarchy (only one place). However, one of the most powerful features of the <span class="phrase">Kablink</span> Teaming templates tool is the ability to create a workspace-folder hierarchy. In this way, you can develop packaged hierarchies.</p>
<p class="para">For example, assume that your organization wants most team workspaces to contain two sub-workspaces, a discussion, a file folder, and a blog. You can use the template designer to create this hierarchy of workspaces and folders. Then, when users create a team workspace, they can select the template you created, and Teaming automatically provides their new team workspace with two sub-workspaces, a discussion, a file folder, and a blog.</p>
<p class="para">After accessing the template tool, select the <span class="guimenu">Workspace</span> button, then click <span class="guimenu">Add</span>. Then provide a title, description, and icon for your template. When you are viewing the Workspace template: [your title] page, there are two menus: <span class="guimenu">Manage this template</span>, and <span class="guimenu">Manage this target</span>. Use <span class="guimenu">Manage this template</span> &gt;<span class="guimenu"> Add workspace template</span> to specify the two sub-workspaces in the example scenario. Use <span class="guimenu">Manage this target</span> to set access control, configure the place, or modify the title, description, or icon.</p>
<p class="para">As you add workspace and folder templates, notice that Teaming displays the Workspace tree just below the menus. Use this tree to navigate to sub-workspaces and folders in the template hierarchy. For example, you need to navigate to a sub-workspace in the template to add a sub-workspace or folder in that place in the templated hierarchy.</p>
