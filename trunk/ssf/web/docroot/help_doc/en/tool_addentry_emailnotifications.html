<h1 class="title"> Understanding E-Mail Notifications</h1>

<p class="para">A folder owner can select a type of notification and a list of people who receive the notification. People's individual subscription settings override those of the folder owner.</p>
<p class="para">Available in folders only, digest notifications are single e-mail messages that contain a summary of all new and changed entries in the folder since the last notification. <span class="phrase">Kablink Teaming</span> reviews recent activity at a schedule determined by the site administrator; if changes occurred, <span class="phrase">Kablink Teaming</span> sends a digest message. Individual notifications are separate e-mail messages for every new or changed entry, and <span class="phrase">Kablink Teaming</span> reviews recent activity every five minutes. Text-messaging notifications are individual notifications that are suitable for display as text messages; these text messages include only the titles of the new or changed entries.</p>
<p class="para">To set up text-message notifications, view your personal workspace, click , and specify an e-mail address to which <span class="phrase">Kablink Teaming</span> sends the text-message notifications. Then, use the subscription form and its Message suitable for text messaging select box to select the e-mail address you just placed in your profile.</p>
<p class="para">People's profiles can contain more than one e-mail address of any type (general e-mail, mobile, and text messaging). Also, <span class="phrase">Kablink Teaming</span> allows people to receive notifications at any number of e-mail addresses of any type. For example, a person can receive two digest notifications and an individual message: one digest going to a work address, one digest going to a home address, and text message notifications going to a cell phone address. When someone subscribes to a folder or entry, under each category of notification (digest, individual, text message), that person uses a select box to select any number of e-mail addresses. Finally, to turn off all notifications (including those sent by folder owners using distribution lists), a person must leave all select boxes blank and must select the Disable notifications... check box. </p>
