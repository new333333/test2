<h1 class="title"> Attachments</h1>

<p class="para">Click one of the Add attachments icons to attach files to the entry. The first icon allows you to drag and drop files, the second one displays a form used to upload files, and the third one allows you to attach results from SiteScape ICEcore Conference meetings.</p>
<p class="para">After you click the first icon, <span class="phrase">Kablink Teaming</span> displays a Folder icon. Select files in another window, drag them over the Folder icon, and release the mouse button (drop them). <span class="phrase">Kablink Teaming</span> displays an opening and closing folder to signify that your dropped files are being uploaded as attachments.</p>
<p class="para">If folders are included in the items you drag and drop, <span class="phrase">Kablink Teaming</span> adds all the files (including files in the folders) but does not include the folder structure.</p>
<p class="para">If the attachment is a picture, <span class="phrase">Kablink Teaming </span> displays a small representation of the picture (a thumbnail picture). Click the linked filename, small picture, or No picture available icon to view an attachment. </p>
<p class="para">For non-picture attachments, <span class="phrase">Kablink Teaming</span> displays links you can use when working with the file (if you have permission). Click the HTML link to view the file in HTML (which is helpful if you do not have the source application needed to work with the file directly), and click the Edit link to edit the file.</p>
