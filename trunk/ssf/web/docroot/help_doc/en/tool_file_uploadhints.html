<p class="para">If you are having trouble uploading a file because the file is too large, you may be able to fix
this by increasing the default amount of memory used by Java Applets. To do this on Windows, go to the Control Panel
(Start/Settings/Control Panel) and click on "Java". This brings up the the Java Control Panel. Select the "Java" tab.
Click on "View" for the Java Applet Runtime Settings. For each of your Java Runtime Versions, add "-Xmx256m" as a 
Java Runtime Parameter. Then click OK. This will cause the applet used for uploading files into a Teaming folder
to start up with 256m of memory. (If the applet now complains that there is not enough memory to run the applet, 
you may have to reduce this number.)
</p>
<p>
After increasing the default memory size for Java Applets, you must exit completely out of all browsers and restart 
them before the change will take effect.
