<h1 class="title"> Using WebDAV</h1>

<p class="para">WebDAV (World Wide Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning) is a standard facilitating collaborative editing and file management. When using Internet Explorer* Version 7.0 or higher, <span class="phrase">Kablink Teaming</span> enables WebDAV tools. You also must be using the Microsoft Windows XP* operating system to use WebDAV tools.</p>
<p class="para">When you click View this folder as a WebDAV folder in the footer tool bar, <span class="phrase">Kablink Teaming</span> invokes a WebDAV window. If the window is not operable, consult with the folder owner or administrator to ensure that the configuration supports WebDAV (folder filenames must be unique). In addition to the footer-tool-bar link, <span class="phrase">Kablink Teaming</span> enables another icon for uploading entry attachments using WebDAV (it appears as the second icon in the set).</p>
<p class="para">Using WebDAV, you need to specify your username and password for <span class="phrase">Kablink Teaming</span> several times when working with files. WebDAV requires several passwords for applications (your browser and <span class="phrase">Kablink Teaming</span>), and it might require a third login when accessing an individual file.</p>
<p class="para">Note: While running the Novell software iChain or Access Manager (NAM) on your server, your users might still be required to sign in multiple times as they use WebDAV with <span class="phrase">Kablink Teaming</span>. Multiple sign-ins using WebDAV are triggered by the client, not by server software.</p>
