<p class="listitem">Any employee submits a request for time off by creating an entry in a folder dedicated to this process. </p>
<p class="listitem">The entry form is custom designed, providing form elements for data such as begin date, end date, and manager's name. The employee is represented internally in the workflow process with the label entry creator. </p>
<p class="listitem">Workflow access controls ensure that employees see only their own time-off requests, and that managers and Human Resources (HR) see all time-off requests. Automatically, the entry enters the initial state called Submitted.</p></li>
          
<li class="listitem">
<p class="listitem">The manager receives a notification that one of her employees just submitted a time-off request. She views the entry in the folder, and answers a workflow question* that approves or denies the request. This feature is available only with the purchase of Advanced Workflow.</p></li>
          
<li class="listitem">
<p class="listitem">If the manager denied the request, the workflow process sends a notification to the entry creator, and the work enters the Denied state.</p></li>
          
<li class="listitem">
<p class="listitem">If the manager approved the request, the workflow process sends a notification to the HR department, and the work enters the Approved state.</p></li>
          
<li class="listitem">
<p class="listitem">After HR records the time off in their database, they change the state of the work to Recorded.</p></li>
