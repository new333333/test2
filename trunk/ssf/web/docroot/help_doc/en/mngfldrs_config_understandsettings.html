<h1 class="title"> Understanding Settings for E-Mail Postings</h1>

<p class="para">First, work with your organization's IT representative who is responsible for creating e-mail accounts used to post messages into <span class="phrase">Kablink</span> Teaming folders. You must both decide between providing distinct e-mail accounts for posting into folders or using a single account with multiple alias addresses, or using a combination of both methods.</p>
<p class="para">It is most common to use aliases. To implement this method, use elements in the XML configuration file (see the installation guide) to indicate that you are using e-mail aliases, and to indicate your e-mail account name and password. The syntax of an e-mail account name differs depending on the type of e-mail sever your organization uses; it might or might not look like an e-mail address. Give the alias address to the folder owner.</p>
<p class="para">For example, the owner of a Marketing folder requests an address for posting into the folder. Within the collab@acme.com e-mail account, your IT representative creates the collab.marketing@acme.com alias address. The folder owner places collab.marketing@acme.com into the posting-configuration form and leaves the password empty. All mail sent to the account through collab.marketing@acme.com is posted into the Marketing folder.</p>
<p class="para">Some systems require a separate e-mail account for each Teaming folder that needs e-mail posting. To implement this method, edit the XML configuration file to indicate that you are not using aliases, and specify null strings for the account name and password. Provide a folder owner with the account name and password, both of which are placed in the posting-configuration form.</p>
<p class="para">After an e-mail is placed in a folder in Teaming, it is deleted from the original e-mail account.</p>
