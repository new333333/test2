<p class="para">Because only folder owners have rights to set the default view of a folder, the <span class="guimenu">Allowed Views</span> section enables the folder owner to select views that external users of the folder are allowed to use, if they are not satisfied with the default view, or feel more comfortable using another view. For example, if you are configuring your Calendar folder and you select <span class="guimenu">Task</span> in this section, then users who view your Calendar folder have the option to view the folder in the Task folder view. </p>
