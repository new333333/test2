<h1 class="title"> Accessory Tools</h1>

<p class="para">Accessories are sections located toward the top of folder pages and toward the bottom of workspace pages; these sections enhance teamwork and communication. The following are a few examples of accessories:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="listbullet">
<li class="listitem">
<p class="listitem">Search results (possibly applied just to the current place)</p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="listitem">Buddy list (perhaps for local subject matter experts)</p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="listitem">Workspace tree (openned to this place in the hierarchy)</p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p class="listitem">Guestbook</p></li></ul></div>

<p class="para">When adding an accessory, you can apply it only to the current place as viewed by you, apply it to all places as viewed by you, or, if you are the owner of a workspace or folder, apply it to this place as viewed by everyone (called a community accessory). After creating a global or community panel, you can establish a default layout (order in which the accessories appear).</p>
<p class="para">To re-order an accessory, click it's title bar, drag it, and, when you see a dark line appear across the page, drop it. You can open and close either the entire panel or individual accessories by clicking the Currently open (down arrow) icon or Currently closed (right arrow) icon. Click the Accessory (round and blue) icon in the upper right corner of an accessory to re-configure it. Click the Close (X) icon to delete an accessory, and delete all accessories to remove the entire panel.</p>
