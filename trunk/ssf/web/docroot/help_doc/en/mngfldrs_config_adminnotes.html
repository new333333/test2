<p class="para">By default, people create teams that are sub-workspaces to the Team workspaces page. If your organization is large, you might want to create a hierarchy within which people can create their team workspaces. For example, you might want to create sub-workspaces in the team area according to geography (North America, South America, Europe, Africa) or organizational function (Executive, Finance, Marketing, Sales, Engineering).</p>
<p class="para">When implementing a hierarchy of team workspaces, be sure to change the configuration of the Team workspaces page so that it uses the "Team workspace" definition (this removes the Add a team workspace button). For any non-root sub-workspaces underneath, create them as workspaces, inherit parent access control, and then re-configure them to be team workspaces. Finally, for the root workspaces (off of which users create their team workspaces), create them using the "Team workspace root" definition (which adds the Add a team workspace button to those pages).</p>
<p class="para">Also, you might want to alter the access control of the sub-workspaces so that people can create their teams only in the appropriate sub-workspaces. Creating group names ahead of time for organizational sub-groups can greatly facilitate this process.</p>
