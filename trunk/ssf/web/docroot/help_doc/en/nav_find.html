<div class="sect1"  id="nav_find">

<h1 class="title"> Finding Specific People, Places, or Tagged Items</h1>

<p class="para">The Find feature is a quick way to navigate to a certain place within <span class="phrase">Kablink</span> Teaming. Use the Find feature to locate people, places, and tags that you know exist on the Teaming site. If you are looking for a subject-matter expert, or want to see what information is available concerning a particular topic, use Teaming <a href="./nav_search.html">Search</a> functionality.</p>
<p class="para">The Find feature provides the following fields:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="listbullet">
<li class="listitem">
<div class="formalpara" id="bjjqdtd">
            <p class="title"><em class="title">People:</em>
            Enables you to quickly navigate to a userâ€™s personal workspace.</p>
          </div>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<div class="formalpara" id="bjjqe3g">
            <p class="title"><em class="title">Places:</em>
            Enables you to quickly navigate to any folder or workspace within Teaming. For example, if you want to locate a colleagueâ€™s Blog folder, simply type Blog, then specify the name of your colleague. The appropriate place is listed in the drop-down list.</p>
          </div>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<div class="formalpara" id="bjjqfwp">
            <p class="title"><em class="title">Tags:</em>
            Enables you to locate any workspaces, folders, or entries that have been tagged. Specify the name of the tag that you are searching for, and click the name in the drop-down list. Teaming displays all of the workspaces, folders, and entries that have been tagged with that particular tag.</p>
          </div>

<p class="listitem">Teaming displays all personal tags, and all community tags for which you have appropriate rights.</p></li></ul></div>

<p class="para">When using these fields, Teaming applies the Type-to-Find feature. As you type, Teaming lists items matching what you have typed so far (all items matching â€œdâ€?, then all items matching â€œdi,â€? for example). </p>
<p class="para">If there is more than one panel of choices, you can click the left-arrow icon and right-arrow icon to review your choices.</p>
