<p class="para">Most of these tools allow quick contact with people who are working with this place or entry. For example, you can e-mail or use SiteScape ICEcore Conference to create a meeting with all people who have created an entry or comment in a folder. You can do the same with all of the folder's team members.</p>
<p class="para">Exceptions include Add files to folder (which you can use to drag and drop files into a folder), the folder or workspace permalink (which presents a URL you can copy and send to people, so they can access a place directly), Subscribe to this entry (which enables e-mail notifications about changes to the entry), and Change theme (which alters the <span class="phrase">Kablink Teaming</span> color scheme).</p>
<p class="para">The clipboard is a tool that you can use to gather people's names as you visit places within <span class="phrase">Kablink Teaming</span>. Later, when using a tool requiring people's names, you can easily reference names on your clipboard. Names remain on the clipboard until you remove them or until you sign off.</p>
<p class="para">When viewing a calendar folder or entry, use the iCal link to export <span class="phrase">Kablink Teaming</span> calendar data for inclusion in another calendar that supports the iCal format (for example, Google* and Outlook*). Click the link, and save the file with an ".ics" file extension, and then import the file into your other calendar (see the Help for your other calendar for more information).</p>
<p class="para">You might also see the View this folder as a WebDAV folder link when viewing a folder.</p>
