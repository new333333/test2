<h1 class="title"> Access Control Overview</h1>

<p class="para">Access control is the method by which you specify which users have the right to perform which tasks in which places. By default, everyone has the right to participate in every global workspace and folder, visit all personal workspaces (read entries and comment about them), create team workspaces, and participate in any team workspaces in which they are a member. The general steps for altering access control are to visit a place in <span class="phrase">Kablink</span> Teaming, click <span class="guimenu">Manage</span> &gt; <span class="guimenu">Access Control</span>, and use the Configure Access Control page to alter the default settings.</p>
<p class="para">Teaming uses role-based access control. With this method, by default, Teaming assigns a role name to six sets of tasks. If you want people to be able to perform the associated set of tasks, you assign the role to them.</p>
<p class="para">By default, places inherit the access settings of their parent. So, by establishing settings for a primary space, all sub-places automatically apply the same settings, saving administration time. To specify settings separate from the parent, visit the place, view the access table, turn off inheritance, click either <span class="guimenu">Add a group</span> or <span class="guimenu">Add a user</span>, and remove and select check boxes as needed.</p>
<p class="para">To alter access-control settings in multiple places, view and use any Configure Access Control page, and click the title of place in the Workspace tree toward the top of the page. <span class="phrase">Kablink Teaming</span> then displays the access control table for the new place. Repeat as often as needed.</p>
