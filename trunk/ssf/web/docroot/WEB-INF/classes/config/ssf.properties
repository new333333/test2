## The following set of information is used to generate URLs from the tiers 
## that do not have access to appropriate web-tier datastructures such as
## HttpServletRequest or PortletRequest.
##

# Web context root (optional) - If unspecified, defaults to /ssf
ssf.ctx=/ssf
# The name of the host for the default zone (required) - 
# This information is used to generate urls for the default zone for a variety
# of client usages including web applications, web services, webdav, RSS feeders
# and email notifications, etc.  Therefore it is imperative to use real host 
# name NOT localhost in production environment. If localhost is used, clients 
# will not be able to access the system through generated urls when they access
# the resources from remote hosts.

# 
# Lucene index writer commit policy
#

# If the number of operations performed on the writer since the "beginning" of last commit 
# exceeds this number, a commit may occur to the index. Note that this is approximation
# not exact number. Since we write to index in batch, the decision to commit to an index
# is evaluated only after a batch of operations is completed. Therefore, the actual number 
# of document changes committed at once may far exceed this floor number.
# Note: In general, time is much better indicator of when to commit than the number of ops. 
#       So, set this to a large number so that most of time commit is triggered by elapsed
#       time rather than the number of ops. Also, setting this to a small number will
#       cancel out the effect of lucene.ram.buffer.size.mb knob above in that too frequent
#       commit will force the buffer to be prematurely flushed to disk, hence greatly
#       reducing the effectiveness of large batch indexing job (eg. re-indexing of entire
#       system).
# The default for local Lucene service is 10K.
lucene.index.commit.number.ops=10000

# If the time of the first doc change operation since the "beginning" of last commit
# goes back farther than this value (represented in second), in other word, if the elapsed 
# time since the oldest uncommitted changes to the index exceeds this value, then a commit
# needs to occur to the index. The idea here is that we don't want to keep uncommitted changes
# uncommitted for longer than this interval.
# The default is 900 (15 minutes).
lucene.index.commit.time.interval=900

# If true, the checking of potential work for commit thread is performed in the calling 
# thread and the result is then used to determine whether to wake up the thread or not.
# If false, the calling thread simply wakes up the commit thread which will then check
# for work.

## Web/Portal Authentication
##

# If set to true, a portal user will be created in the Teaming internal user database

# exist, the authentication fails and an exception is thrown.
# Default is true.

# List of attributes to update from the portal to SSF user database. 
# Not all portals may provide this information. So the actual data copied may
# be a subset of the attributes listed here. For example, timeZone is not
# available for copying on JBoss portal.
# NOTE: changes in the user title (firstName, middleName, or lastName) will cause 
# reindexing of all entries create by this user.  If using ldap synchronization 
# only timeZone and locale should be set below.
# The others can be copied from ldap during synchronziation.
# If not using ldap sync, you add any of the following attributes and they will be 
# coped from the portal at login. 
# Others from portal include firstName, middleName, lastName, emailAddress, organization.
portal.user.auto.synchronize=timeZone, locale, emailAddress, lastName, firstName, middleName

# If set to true, the password in the Teaming internal user database is 
# automatically synchronized to the password in the source user space
# external to Teaming, whether it is the portal database or LDAP directory
# service, assuming that such clear-text password is available. 
# This synchronization takes place at the time of successful user login. 
# If this property is false and the two passwords do not match at the time of 
# login and portal.password.ignore is false, the user is denied access to Teaming. 
# Default is false.
portal.password.auto.synchronize=false

# If the following is set to true, Teaming's authentication function will
# not use the password passed by the portal at the time of login for the
# purpose of authentication. It does not necessarily mean that the password 
# is bad or should be discarded. 
# This setting is used in an environment where the authentication decision 
# is made against a user space external to Teaming, for example, the portal 
# database or LDAP directory service. This property has no effect if 
# portal.password.auto.synchronize is true.
# Default is true.
portal.password.ignore=true

##
## Portal/Teaming synchronization
##

# If the following is set to true, when deleting a user from portal interface,
# it will also not only delete the corresponding user account from ICEcore side
# but also the user's workspace as well. Deleting user workspace results in
# deletion of all of its folders, sub-folders and entries including source 
# content if any folders or sub-folders are mirrored folders.

## Feb 20 2007
## Edit in place can use either 'webdav' or 'applet'
## 'webdav' option works only for IE
## 'applet' option works for both IE and Firefox
## 
## On Internet Explorer browser if 'webdav' option is chosen then only the '.doc', '.ppt' and '.xls' files can be opened
## 
## Steps to be followed for 'webdav' option to work in Internet Explorer 6
## 
## Step 1: Open file types in a new window
## 
## 1a. Go to Windows Explorer
## 1b. Choose Menu option Tools >> Folder Options...
## 1c. Go to Tab 'File Types'. You will see the list of registered file types.
## 1d. In the registered file type list Choose Extension >> DOC
## 1e. Click on the 'Advanced' button in the same window
## 1f. This opens 'Edit Open Type' window. There uncheck the checkbox 'Browse in same window'
## 1g. Click the OK button
## 1h. Repeat the steps '1d' to '1g' for extension types 'PPT' and 'XLS'
## 
## Step 2: To open documents in IE in writable format (Registry Change)
## 
## Follow the steps in this article: http://support.microsoft.com:80/?kbid=870853
## 
##What should be the edit in place functionality that must be used
##Allowed options are 'applet' (applet thru weddav) or 'webdav' (native OS webdav functionality)
##TODO: Need to change the 'webdav' to 'nativeOS'
##
##Before setting edit.in.place.for.ie to "webdav" look at the following Microsoft articles: 
##Office 2003 documents open read-only in Internet Explorer
##Article ID : 870853
##
##How to change Internet Explorer to open linked files in Word 2000 instead of in the browser

## Additional file extensions that are excluded from being indexed by
## OpenOffice (OO) in Kablink Teaming.
##
## Note:  The extensions specified here are in addition to those that
##        are excluded by default, as specified in the
##        "textOpenOfficeConverter" <bean> definition in
##        applicationContext.xml.  As of 20100107, the set of
##        extensions defined there was:
##
##           jpg,jpeg,gif,tiff,png,exe,mpeg,mov,bmp,exe,wav,wma,mpa,mp3,mpg,mp4,swf,ogg,m4a,flv,bin
##
## Background:
##    For search index generation on Kablink Teaming, files are fed
##    through OO in an attempt to extract the word list to add to the
##    search index.  On Windows, this doesn't pose a problem in that OO
##    there gracefully handles files that it does not understand.  We
##    don't get the index word list for the files it doesn't
##    understand, but there's no catastrophic failure.
## 
##    On Linux, it's a different story.  Using the EXACT SAME version
##    of OO on Linux as we use on Windows, some file types ALWAYS crash
##    OO.  When that happens, all HTML and index generation stops.
##
##    Administrators can use this to tell Teaming to EXCLUDE one or
##    more additional extensions from OO index generation.  That way,
##    if, in a given environment, certain file types cause OO to crash,
##    an administrator can work around the problem by excluding files
##    of that type from the index generation conversion.  Typically,
##    the issue comes up for file types that OO doesn't natively
##    understand.

## to the server using efficient file copy mechanisms such as FTP. 
## The files can even be put on a DVD and mounted on the system. 
## Then, the user can make web services call from the client side and specify
## the path to the individual file relative to the staging directory.
## Then the system can get the content from the file designated by the path 
## and attach it to the entry being created or modified.

# files waiting to be attached to one or more entries. Only those files
# whose paths are relative to this root can be utilized properly.
# This directory must be directly accessible to the Teaming server. 
# It is important NOT to leave this blank so that the system can restrict
# the staging area for obvious security reason.
staging.upload.files.rootpath=

# Set to true to let the system automatically delete the file after the

# entry.inputdata.map contains string pairs that are mapped when input
# into an entry form.  For example:  If entry.inputdata.map is set to
# "foo,bar", all occurences of "foo" in an entry form's input would be
# replaced by "bar".
#
# Notes:
# 1. The predefined pairs correspond to bulleted item sequences as
#    copied from a PDF file.   If not mapped, writing these to the
#    database causes a constraint violation.  The mappings here change
#    them to a bullet character (\u2022) that can be stored.
# 2. If entry.inputdata.map contains an odd number of items, the last string in
#    the sequence will be ignored.
# 3. If entry.inputdata.map is not defined or contains no items, no mappings
#    will be performed.
