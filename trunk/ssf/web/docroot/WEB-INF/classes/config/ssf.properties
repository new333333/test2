## The following set of information is used to generate URLs from the tiers 
## that do not have access to appropriate web-tier datastructures such as
## HttpServletRequest or PortletRequest.
##

# Web context root (optional) - If unspecified, defaults to /ssf
ssf.ctx=/ssf
# The name of the host for the default zone (required) - 
# This information is used to generate urls for the default zone for a variety
# of client usages including web applications, web services, webdav, RSS feeders
# and email notifications, etc.  Therefore it is imperative to use real host 
# name NOT localhost in production environment. If localhost is used, clients 
# will not be able to access the system through generated urls when they access
# the resources from remote hosts.
ssf.default.host=localhost
# The port number on all hosts (optional) - If unspecified, defaults to 80

# Turn on or off usage of a compound file.
# The Teaming default is false (The Lucene default is "true" for Lucene 2.9.1)

#
# The maximum number of terms that will be indexed for an individual field within a document.

# 
# Lucene index writer commit policy
#

# If the number of operations performed on the writer since the "beginning" of last commit 
# exceeds this number, a commit may occur to the index. Note that this is approximation
# not exact number. Since we write to index in batch, the decision to commit to an index
# is evaluated only after a batch of operations is completed. Therefore, the actual number 
# of document changes committed at once may far exceed this floor number.
# Note: In general, time is much better indicator of when to commit than the number of ops. 
#       So, set this to a large number so that most of time commit is triggered by elapsed
#       time rather than the number of ops. Also, setting this to a small number will
#       cancel out the effect of lucene.ram.buffer.size.mb knob above in that too frequent
#       commit will force the buffer to be prematurely flushed to disk, hence greatly
#       reducing the effectiveness of large batch indexing job (eg. re-indexing of entire
#       system).
# The default for local Lucene service is 10K.
lucene.index.commit.number.ops=10000

# If the time of the first doc change operation since the "beginning" of last commit
# goes back farther than this value (represented in second), in other word, if the elapsed 
# time since the oldest uncommitted changes to the index exceeds this value, then a commit
# needs to occur to the index. The idea here is that we don't want to keep uncommitted changes
# uncommitted for longer than this interval.
# The default is 900 (15 minutes).
lucene.index.commit.time.interval=900

# If true, the checking of potential work for commit thread is performed in the calling 
# thread and the result is then used to determine whether to wake up the thread or not.
# If false, the calling thread simply wakes up the commit thread which will then check
# for work. 
# The default is false.
lucene.index.commit.check.for.work.in.calling.thread=false

##
## Indexing-time boost values for full-text application/business fields.
## Changing these settings don't come to effect until all affected documents are re-indexed.
## Default is 1.0.

# Indexing-time boost value for "description" field.
lucene.index.field.boost.description=2.0

## Web/Portal Authentication
##

# If set to true, a portal user will be created in the Teaming internal user database
# if it doesn't already exist, at the time of login.  If false and the user doesn't
# exist, the authentication fails and an exception is thrown.
# Default is true.

# List of attributes to update from the portal to SSF user database. 
# Not all portals may provide this information. So the actual data copied may
# be a subset of the attributes listed here. For example, timeZone is not
# available for copying on JBoss portal.
# NOTE: changes in the user title (firstName, middleName, or lastName) will cause 
# reindexing of all entries create by this user.  If using ldap synchronization 
# only timeZone and locale should be set below.
# The others can be copied from ldap during synchronziation.
# If not using ldap sync, you add any of the following attributes and they will be 
# coped from the portal at login. 
# Others from portal include firstName, middleName, lastName, emailAddress, organization.
portal.user.auto.synchronize=timeZone, locale, emailAddress, lastName, firstName, middleName

# If set to true, the password in the Teaming internal user database is 
# automatically synchronized to the password in the source user space
# external to Teaming, whether it is the portal database or LDAP directory
# service, assuming that such clear-text password is available. 
# This synchronization takes place at the time of successful user login. 
# If this property is false and the two passwords do not match at the time of 
# login and portal.password.ignore is false, the user is denied access to Teaming. 
# Default is true (as of Filr)
portal.password.auto.synchronize=true

# If the following is set to true, Teaming's authentication function will
# not use the password passed by the portal at the time of login for the
# purpose of authentication. It does not necessarily mean that the password 
# is bad or should be discarded. 
# This setting is used in an environment where the authentication decision 
# is made against a user space external to Teaming, for example, the portal 
# database or LDAP directory service. This property has no effect if 
# portal.password.auto.synchronize is true.
# Default is true.
portal.password.ignore=true

##
## Portal/Teaming synchronization
##

# If the following is set to true, when deleting a user from portal interface,
# it will also not only delete the corresponding user account from ICEcore side
# but also the user's workspace as well. Deleting user workspace results in
# deletion of all of its folders, sub-folders and entries including source 
# content if any folders or sub-folders are mirrored folders.
portal.profile.deleteUserWorkspace=false

##
## Archive Encryption Password
##
## If a file is encrypted and gets deleted, then the file is decrypted first, 
## then re-encrypted using this common password so it can be decrypted if necessary
## This is necessary because the encryption key gets deleted when the file deletion is requested

## File extensions that support edit-in-place via WebDAV 
## File extension matching is performed case insensitively
##

##
## Feb 20 2007
## Edit in place can use either 'webdav' or 'applet'
## 'webdav' option works only for IE
## 'applet' option works for IE, Firefox and Safari
## 
## On Internet Explorer browser if 'webdav' option is chosen then only the '.doc', '.ppt' and '.xls' files can be opened
## 
## Steps to be followed for 'webdav' option to work in Internet Explorer 6
## 
## Step 1: Open file types in a new window
## 
## 1a. Go to Windows Explorer
## 1b. Choose Menu option Tools >> Folder Options...
## 1c. Go to Tab 'File Types'. You will see the list of registered file types.
## 1d. In the registered file type list Choose Extension >> DOC
## 1e. Click on the 'Advanced' button in the same window
## 1f. This opens 'Edit Open Type' window. There uncheck the checkbox 'Browse in same window'
## 1g. Click the OK button
## 1h. Repeat the steps '1d' to '1g' for extension types 'PPT' and 'XLS'
## 
## Step 2: To open documents in IE in writable format (Registry Change)
## 
## Follow the steps in this article: http://support.microsoft.com:80/?kbid=870853
## 
##What should be the edit in place functionality that must be used
##Allowed options are 'applet' (applet thru weddav) or 'webdav' (native OS webdav functionality)
##TODO: Need to change the 'webdav' to 'nativeOS'

## Temporary file cleanup.
##
## There is a system level timer that is used to perform temporary file
## cleanups.  This timer is normally scheduled to run once a day.
## However, the time and frequency of this operation can be changed.
## Set the following hours and minutes as needed.  These valees use the
## syntax as defined by the Quartz Scheduler.  For example, setting the
## hours variable to "*" will trigger the cleanup operation on every
## hour.  Setting the minutes variable to "*/5" will trigger every 5
## minutes.
##
## Default is to run it every day at 1:00 AM.
##
## temp.file.cleanup.age.minutes controls how old (in minutes)
##    files to be deleted must be.  Default:  1440 minutes (1 day.)
##    A value of 0 will disable all temporary file cleanups.

##    file.createFileTypes=.docx,.ods,.odt,.xlsx          //Note: these 4 templates are already present in Durango
## For this to work properly, you must create an empty template file for each file type in this list and add them to
##    "webapps/ssf/WEB-INF/classes/config/file_templates". These files are used as templates to create 
##    the empty files. This facility is latent in Durango. It is expected to be made official in Evergreen.

## 
## Additional file extensions that are excluded from being indexed by
## OpenOffice (OO) in Kablink Teaming.
##
## Note:  The extensions specified here are in addition to those that
##        are excluded by default, as specified in the
##        "textOpenOfficeConverter" <bean> definition in
##        applicationContext.xml.  As of 20100107, the set of
##        extensions defined there was:
##
##           jpg,jpeg,gif,tiff,png,exe,mpeg,mov,bmp,exe,wav,wma,mpa,mp3,mpg,mp4,swf,ogg,m4a,flv,bin
##
## Background:
##    For search index generation on Kablink Teaming, files are fed
##    through OO in an attempt to extract the word list to add to the
##    search index.  On Windows, this doesn't pose a problem in that OO
##    there gracefully handles files that it does not understand.  We
##    don't get the index word list for the files it doesn't
##    understand, but there's no catastrophic failure.
## 
##    On Linux, it's a different story.  Using the EXACT SAME version
##    of OO on Linux as we use on Windows, some file types ALWAYS crash
##    OO.  When that happens, all HTML and index generation stops.
##
##    Administrators can use this to tell Teaming to EXCLUDE one or
##    more additional extensions from OO index generation.  That way,
##    if, in a given environment, certain file types cause OO to crash,
##    an administrator can work around the problem by excluding files
##    of that type from the index generation conversion.  Typically,
##    the issue comes up for file types that OO doesn't natively
##    understand.

# A comma separated list of file extensions that are subject to file-level XSS check. 
# If user is uploading a file that matches one of the extensions listed here, XSS check is
# performed on the content of the file. The file extension is compared case-insensitively. 
# By default we don't check any files. However, you should check .htm and .html files to be totally secure.
# But if you do filter htm and html files, then that will prevent most htm and html file from being attached
# even if they don't pose a real XSS threat. (This is because most html files contain some javascript or meta tags.)
xss.content.filter.file.extensions=
# To protect against XSS threats in uploaded html files, set the following to true.
# If you want to allow html files to be viewed without being checked for XSS threats, set this to false.

## XSS (Cross Site Scripting) check using org.kablink.teaming.util.stringcheck.XSSCheck
##

# Enable checking against XSS.
# If false, the value of xss.check.mode has no effect. 
xss.check.enable=true

# Default XSS checking mode. This value is effective only when xss.check.enable is true. 
# Must be one of the following 4 available values:
#
# disallow - If XSS is detected, the operation is not allowed to proceed.
# This is the default value.
# 
# strip - If XSS is detected, the offending part in the input data is stripped 
# off and the operation is allowed to proceed normally with the modified data.
#
# trusted.disallow - If the executing user matches one of the listed users or
# belongs to one of the listed groups, XSS check is bypassed and the operation 
# is allowed to proceed normally with no modifications to the input data.
# If the user doesn't match the list of users or groups, the logic falls back
# to the "disallow" option.   
#
# trusted.strip - If the executing user matches one of the listed users or
# belongs to one of the listed groups, XSS check is bypassed and the operation 
# is allowed to proceed normally with no modifications to the input data.
# If the user doesn't match the list of users or groups, the logic falls back
# to the "strip" option.   
#
# The lists of trusted groups and users are founf in the zone.cfg.xml file
#   xssConfiguration/trustedGroups/group  and  xssConfiguration/trustedUsers/user
#
# This setting can be overridden on an individual call basis. Specifically, the
# org.kablink.teaming.module.file.impl.XSSContentFilter overrides this default 
# setting by always specifying trusted.disallow on an individual call. 
xss.check.mode.default=trusted.strip

# This mode is applicable to file content only. None of the "strip" options are supported.
#  Only "disallow", "trusted.disallow", ""

## Properties to aid with efficient and/or bulk file uploads. 
##
## Normally, when remote client uploads a file to attach it to an entry, 
## the file content travels cross the wire, which could be problematic when 
## dealing with very large files. This mechanism opens up a backdoor to allow 
## user to pre-copy the source files to a directory accessible directly 
## to the server using efficient file copy mechanisms such as FTP. 
## The files can even be put on a DVD and mounted on the system. 
## Then, the user can make web services call from the client side and specify
## the path to the individual file relative to the staging directory.
## Then the system can get the content from the file designated by the path 
## and attach it to the entry being created or modified. 
##

# Enable/disable the capability. The default is false. 
staging.upload.files.enable=false

# Specifies absolute path to the directory used for temporarily staging 
# files waiting to be attached to one or more entries. Only those files
# whose paths are relative to this root can be utilized properly.
# This directory must be directly accessible to the Teaming server. 
# It is important NOT to leave this blank so that the system can restrict
# the staging area for obvious security reason.
staging.upload.files.rootpath=

# Set to true to let the system automatically delete the file after the
# file is successfully attached to an entry. The attempt will be made
# only if this value is true and the file is not read-only. When set to
# false, it is the user's responsibility to clear or remove the source
# files after use. The default is false.

## Encryption algorithm used to encrypt user passwords. (pre Teaming 3.0)
## The default algorithm is MD5 for compatibility with earlier versions
## of the product. But it is highly recommended to use SHA or SHA-256 
## for new installations.
## 
## NOTE: As of Teaming 3.0, this property is deprecated. The runtime will
## still consult this property to learn which encryption algorithm was used

# When defined, the following are used as the 'from' address for eMails
# (other than subscription notifications) sent from Teaming.
#
# There are two methods of naming supported, zone specific and global.
#
#    The zone specific method uses the following format:
#       ssf.outgoing.from.address.<zone name>=zoned@company.com
#    where '<zone name>' is replaced by the name given to the zone when
#    created via the Teaming administration pages.  Note that the name
#    of the default Teaming zone is 'kablink'.
#
#    The global method uses the following format: 
#       ssf.outgoing.from.address=global@company.com
#
# The implementation that makes use of these first searches for a zone
# specific setting.  If found, that is used.  If a zone specific
# setting is not found, it looks for a global version.  If that is
# found, it is used.  Otherwise, the from address will be determined as
# it would have been before this feature was added.

#
# Supports both zone zpecific and global setting.
#
# Values:
#    true - All outgoing emails use the from override.

#    activity.stream.display.words:  Defines the number of words to
#       display for an activity stream before it gets truncated with
#       a "...".  If this is set to -1 (which is the default), there
#       will be no truncation.  Note that the Teaming Feed feature
#       uses a count of 50 for this truncation value.  If you want
#       similar results displayed by the activity stream feature as
#       is displayed by the feed feature, set this to 50.
#    activity.stream.interval.refresh.client:  Defines how often,
#       in seconds, clients (i.e., browsers) should check for updates
#       in an activity.  (Default:  60 seconds -> 1 minute.)
#    activity.stream.maxhits:  Defines the maximum number of search
#       results processed when the activity stream caching code is
#       trying to analyze which binders contain changes.  This is the
#       TOTAL number of hits that will be read and processed to
#       determine which binders, if any contain changes since the
#       previous update cycle.  (Default:  1000.)
#    activity.stream.read.entry.days:  When showing read or unread
#       items in an activity stream, the number of days worth of
#       activity that are taken into consideration.  Note that the
#       Vibe only tracks read items for 30 days for a user so this
#       should not exceed that.  (Default:  30.)
#    activity.stream.read.entry.max:  When showing read or unread items

#    templates.    
#
# velocity.engine.modification.check.interval:
#    The number of seconds between modification checks when caching is
#    turned on.  When this is an integer > 0, this represents the
#    number of seconds between checks to see if the template was
#    modified.  If the template has been modified since last check,
#    then it is reloaded and reparsed.  Otherwise nothing is done.
#    When <= 0, no modification checks will take place, and assuming
#    that the property cache (above) is true, once a template is loaded
#    and parsed the first time it is used, it will not be checked or
