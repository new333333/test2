<p class="para">This tool is particularly useful when you are using the calendar view to review information that is designed for another folder type. For example, you can use a wiki or discussion with its default view. Then, if the folder owner or administrator configured it to support this action, you could use the calendar view to see which entries had the most recent activity (for example, which entries have been most recently edited). You can also view entries according to creation date.</p>
