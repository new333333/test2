<div class="sect1"  id="nav_search_results">

<h1 class="title"> Using the Search Results Page</h1>

<p class="para">After conducting a search, the search results page provides tools in the left sidebar, and displays search criteria at the top of the right column, which are immediately followed by items found to match the criteria.</p>
<p class="para">In the Saved searches section of the tools sidebar, you can provide a name for the current search and then click Save. Later, in the navigation bar, you can click the down arrow icon (next to the Search icon) and click the linked name of a saved search you wish to conduct again.</p>
<p class="para">The tools sidebar also provides links to the top ranked places and people involved with matching items. With items at the top of the list being most relevant, these lists tell you places where your search topic is most often being discussed and who is most often contributing to the discussion. Finally, the tools sidebar lists tags that have been applied to matched items.</p>
<p class="para">Notice that, as you conduct searches, SiteScape ICEcore Enterprise places links to each search in the Recent places section of the tools sidebar, so you can easily perform a recent search again. However, because SiteScape ICEcore Enterprise saves only a few of your most recently visited places and searches, use Saved searches for ones that you want to make available to you permanently, until you delete it.</p>
