<h1 class="title"> Creating Dedicated Applications</h1>

<p class="para">Using the designers, definitions, workflow, and configuration tools, you can create dedicated applications. For example, you can use a folder in SiteScape ICEcore Enterprise as a platform on which to build a powerful application that maps to a business process in your organization.</p>
<p class="para">Here are the general steps you can take to create dedicated applications:</p>
<div class="procedure">
<ol class="steps">
<li class="step" id="bi0nkb8">
<p class="para">Use the entry designer to create an entry to be used in your business process. For example, if creating a "request for paid time off (PTO)" application, you probably need entry fields for a start date, end date, and manager's name.</p></li>
<li class="step" id="bi0nkd3">
<p class="para">Use the workflow designer to create a PTO process.</p></li>
<li class="step" id="bi0nkgo">
<p class="para">In a test folder, associate the workflow with the new entry, test it, and adjust your new entry and workflow process. (Consider having users test the application before placing it in a production ready folder.)</p></li>
<li class="step" id="bi0nkiq">
<p class="para">Create a folder, and configure it so that the only default entry is the new entry you created and associate the new entry with your PTO process. The application for this folder is dedicated, because the folder contains only requests for PTO requests.</p></li>
<li class="step" id="bi0nkkj">
<p class="para">Configure allowable views that make sense for your application. For example, because requests for PTO have begin and end dates, managers might find it useful to see a calendar view displaying all of their employees' requests in a given month.</p></li></ol>
