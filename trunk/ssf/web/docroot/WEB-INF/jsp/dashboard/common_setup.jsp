//This file is included for summary portlets, dashboards and ajax callbacks for both
//In the portlet case include.jsp has already been called and include files have been handled
//In the dashboard case if not in an adapter, the variables to skip the includes are setup
//In the ajax callback case, we don't want to send the includes
//So in all cases at this point, all files included from "include.jsp" are handled.
//Set flags to skip them, but still need rest of the setup in "include.jsp"
