help.getStartedProduct.subtopic.workspaces=Understanding workspaces 
help.getStartedProduct.subtopic.folders=Understanding folders 
help.getStartedProduct.subtopic.getStarted=Getting started 

##
## Understanding workspaces  ####
##
#The first two are combined into one paragraph
help.getStartedProduct.content.workspaces.intro=<span class="new_term">Workspaces</span> are starting \
places for individuals and teams who want to do a certain type of work. 
help.getStartedProduct.content.workspaces.defaults=By default, there are four \
organizational workspaces: the top "Workspaces" workspace, and subworkspaces entitled \
"Global workspaces," "Personal workspaces," and "Team workspaces". 
help.getStartedProduct.content.workspaces.defined=<span class="new_term">Global \
workspaces</span> is a container for information available to anyone in your organization. \
<span class="new_term">Personal workspaces</span> contains links to personal information \
(such as contact information, a personal blog, and more) for everyone in your organization. \
<span class="new_term">Team workspaces</span> contains team-specific work. \
Workspaces can contain subworkspaces and folders.
help.getStartedProduct.content.workspaces.projects=Workspace owners can create a \
<span class="new_term">project-management workspace</span>. Workspaces of this type \
typically appear in either the Global or Team workspace areas. They include tools \
for reviewing project milestones and the status of specific tasks.

##
## Understanding folders  ####
##
help.getStartedProduct.content.folders.listIntro=At the workspace level, \
you can organize your work further using folders, which, in turn, can contain subfolders. \
These are types of folders that workspace owners can create in {0}:
help.getStartedProduct.content.folders.listItem.discussion=\
<span class="def_list_term">Discussion</span>--Topics and posted comments about each topic
help.getStartedProduct.content.folders.listItem.file=\
<span class="def_list_term">File</span>--A library of uploaded files
help.getStartedProduct.content.folders.listItem.calendar=\
<span class="def_list_term">Calendar</span>--Important dates and appointments
help.getStartedProduct.content.folders.listItem.photoAlbum=\
<span class="def_list_term">Photo album</span>--A collection of pictures
help.getStartedProduct.content.folders.listItem.guestbook=\
<span class="def_list_term">Guestbook</span>--Signatures and comments from visitors
help.getStartedProduct.content.folders.listItem.blog=\
<span class="def_list_term">Blog</span>--A chronological list of journal entries
help.getStartedProduct.content.folders.listItem.wiki=\
<span class="def_list_term">Wiki</span>--A set of pages coauthored by participants
help.getStartedProduct.content.folders.listItem.survey=\
<span class="def_list_term">Survey</span>--Polling questions posed to participants
help.getStartedProduct.content.folders.listItem.task=\
<span class="def_list_term">Task</span>--Tracked action items
help.getStartedProduct.content.folders.listItem.milestone=\
<span class="def_list_term">Milestone</span>--A project summary based on task completion

##
## Getting started  ####
##
help.getStartedProduct.getStarted.intro=To get started using {0}, click the \
<span class="clickable_item">My workspace</span> icon. Add a few pictures to your \
Personal workspace, write an introduction, and add a journal entry in your blog folder. \
As visitors, other people can view your contact information and entries, and \
they can comment on entries. However, they cannot edit your entries or add new entries. 
help.getStartedProduct.getStarted.team=After experimenting with some of the tasks \
in the quick-start guide, you can invite a few trusted people into your personal \
workspace in a more expanded role. For example, you can view your discussion folder, \
use the \
<span class="clickable_item">Team</span> > <span class="clickable_item">Add or delete team members</span> \
menu item to specify a few names. Then, those people can create \
new entries in your folder, enabling a higher level of collaboration.
help.getStartedProduct.getStarted.teamWorkspace=If your team requires a larger, private workspace \
with more collaboration tools (for example, a team calendar, tasks folder, or wiki), then \
view the <span class="clickable_item">Team workspaces</span> page (or the workspace \
specified by your {0} administrator), click the \
<span class="clickable_item">Add a team workspace</span> button, and create your \
new team workspace. By default, only your team members may view and use this workspace.

##  Understanding teams
##
help.understandingTeams.topic=Understanding {0} teams
help.understandingTeams.intro=Generally, a <span class="new_term">team</span> \
is a group of people working together toward a shared goal. <span class="new_term">{0} teams</span> \
provide you with a dedicated area in which to collaborate online, and \
to communicate quickly and easily with teammates.
help.understandingTeams.teamWorkspace=By default, all people using {0} \
can create a Team workspace, which provides your team with a dedicated work area. \
After you create your Team workspace, add as many subworkspaces or folders (discussions, \
file libraries, wikis, blogs, and so on) as you need for your work.
help.understandingTeams.globalWorkspace={0} supports a second type of team designed primarily for \
use in the Global-workspaces tree. Although Global workspaces are often open to participation \
by everyone, the owner of a workspace or folder may want to create a team of \
people who are to serve a special function in that place (for example, subject-matter experts \
who rate entries, or moderators). In this case, the owner can use the \
<span class="clickable_item">Team</span> > <span class="clickable_item">Add or delete team members</span> \
menu item to create that team and can use access-control settings to grant additional privileges. 
help.understandingTeams.communicate={0} communication tools allow for quicker use \
among team members. For example, in a Team workspace, if you click the \
<span class="clickable_item">Meet</span> link at the bottom of a workspace or \
folder, click <span class="clickable_item">Team members</span>, \
and click <span class="clickable_item">Start meeting now</span>, then {0} initiates a \
Zon meeting without you having to specify team names individually. Membership in a team \
facilitates use of the clipboard, Zon IM, and e-mail, as well.
# For more info is a global tag.
help.createTeam.subTopic.grantAccess=Allowing non-team members to be visitors
help.createTeam.subTopic.siteAdminNotes=Site-administration notes

##
## Create teams: grant access   ####
##
help.setTeamAccess.content.intro=In addition to participating team members, you might want to \
allow other people to visit your team workspace in a more limited capacity. For example, you \
can add people to the Visitor role, which restricts them to reading or commenting on existing \
entries.
help.setTeamAccess.content.listIntro=To grant visitor access to people:
help.setTeamAccess.content.listItem.viewPage=View your Team workspace.
help.setTeamAccess.content.listItem.aclMenu=Click the \
<span class="clickable_item">Access control</span> button. {0} displays the \
"Configure access control" page.
help.setTeamAccess.content.listItem.noInherit=In the "This folder inherits..." section, click the \
<span class="clickable_item">No</span> radio \
button, then click the <span class="clickable_item">Apply</span> button.
help.setTeamAccess.content.listItem.addUser=Click the <span class="clickable_item">Add a user</span> \
column header, type the first few letters of person''s first or last name, and then, in the drop-down list, \
click the linked name. {0} adds a row to the table for that person.
help.setTeamAccess.content.listItem.enableUser=In newly created row, check the box in the Visitor \
column.
help.setTeamAccess.content.listItem.repeat=Repeat the last two steps until you have added \
all the visitors you want.
help.setTeamAccess.content.listItem.saveChanges=Click the \
<span class="clickable_item">Save changes</span> button.
# Click Close is a global string.

##
## Site administration notes   ####
##
help.createTeam.siteAdminNotes.content.intro=By default, people create teams that are subworkspaces \
to the "Team workspaces" page. If your organization is large, you may want to create a \
hierarchy within which people can create their team workspaces. For example, you may want to \
create subworkspaces in the team area according to geography \
(North America, South America, Europe, Africa) or organizational function (Executive, Finance, \
Marketing, Sales, Engineering).
help.createTeam.siteAdminNotes.content.howTo=When implementing a hierarchy of team workspaces, \
be sure to change the configuration of the "Team workspaces" page so that it uses the \
"Team workspace" definition (this removes the <span class="clickable_item">Add a team workspace</span> \
button). For any non-root subworkspaces underneath, create them as workspaces, inherit parent \
access control, and then re-configure them to be team workspaces.  Finally, for the root \
workspaces (off of which users create their team workspaces), create then using the \
"Team workspace root" definition (which adds the \
<span class="clickable_item">Add a team workspace</span> button).
help.createTeam.siteAdminNotes.content.access=Also, you might want to alter the access control \
of the subworkspaces so that people can create their teams only in the appropriate subworkspaces. \
Creating group names ahead of time for organizational subgroups can greatly facilitate this process.

help.configIntro.content.listItem.initial=<span class="def_list_term">Initial</span>--Enables \
minimal {0} functioning (examples include e-mail scheduling and LDAP settings).
help.configIntro.content.listItem.prepopulation=<span class="def_list_term">Prepopulation</span>--Creates \

help.configIntro.subTopic.designers=Understanding designers
help.configIntro.subTopic.applyDefs=Applying configuration settings
help.configIntro.subTopic.dedicatedApps=Creating dedicated applications
help.configIntro.subTopic.templates=Using templates
##
##   Explaining definitions  ####
##
help.configIntro.understandDefs.intro=To configure {0}, it is helpful to understand \
the design that supports objects in the user interface. First, consider various categories of \
objects. Generally, there are <span class="new_term">workspaces</span> and \
<span class="new_term">folders</span> (places), and <span class="new_term">entries</span> (things). \
Furthermore, there are <span class="new_term">Personal workspaces</span>  \
and <span class="new_term">profiles</span> of contact information (people), and files \
<span class="new_term">attached</span> to entries (also things).
help.configIntro.understandDefs.subcategories=To support a specific collaboration purpose, \
each category can have subcategories. Consider the folder category. To refine its purpose, \
a folder can be a discussion, blog, wiki, file, photo album, guestbook, and so on. 
help.configIntro.understandDefs.definitions=A <span class="new_term">definition</span> is set of \
elements that affect the content and appearance of an object subcategory. Continuing the folder example, \
the wiki definition establishes both the form used to create a wiki folder \
(called <span class="new_term">the form</span>) and contents seen when displaying a wiki folder \
(called <span class="new_term">the view</span>). 
help.configIntro.understandDefs.instances=Finally, consider the difference between \
a category (say, "a wiki folder") and a created object that belongs to that \
category (say, "Acme company policies and procedures wiki"). When you direct {0} to \
create an object, it requires a set of default configuration settings to apply to \
the newly created object.
help.configIntro.understandDefs.templates=A <span class="new_term">template</span> is the \
set of default configuration settings used to create a new place (workspace or folder). \
A template includes a definition (the form and view used to create and display the object), \
default access control settings (usually "inherit from parent"), and often much more.  For example, \
templates for folders include default entry types (wiki folders should contain \
wiki entries), a list of allowable views (possibly presenting wiki data in a discussion \
table, or time ordered like a calendar), a default view (wiki folders should default \
to a wiki folder display), and more.
##
##   Using form and view designers ####
##
help.configIntro.designers.intro=Using the "Form and view designers," you can alter \
default definitions or create new ones. 
help.configIntro.designers.getStarted=To use these tools, click the plus sign \
(<span class="clickable_item">+</span>) next to "Form and view designers" in the administration portlet, \
and then click the category with which you wish to work.
help.configIntro.designers.listIntro={0} offers these designers:
help.configIntro.designers.listItem.entries=<span class="def_list_term">Entry designer</span>--Definitions \
for entries.
help.configIntro.designers.listItem.folders=<span class="def_list_term">Folder designer</span>--Definitions \
for folders.
help.configIntro.designers.listItem.profiles=<span class="def_list_term">Profile designer</span>--Definitions \
for contact information (<span class="clickable_item">Modify profile</span>).
help.configIntro.designers.listItem.profileListing=\
<span class="def_list_term">Profile listing designer</span>--Definitions for the "Personal workspaces" page.
help.configIntro.designers.listItem.workflow=<span class="def_list_term">Workflow designer</span>--Definitions \
for workflow processes.
help.configIntro.designers.listItem.userWorkspaces=\
<span class="def_list_term">User workspace designer</span>--Definitions for Personal workspaces.
help.configIntro.designers.listItem.workspaces=<span class="def_list_term">Workspace designer</span>--Definitions \
for Global and Team workspaces.
help.configIntro.designers.using=When using the non-workflow designers, click the plus \
sign (<span class="clickable_item">+</span>) to expand the tree until you can see the view \
and form. Click a title of an element you want to modify or that is near the location of a new \
element, and then use the tools presented to the right of the tree to add, modify, delete, or \
move elements. To guide your work, the designer displays a preview of the form toward the bottom of the page.
help.configIntro.designers.restrictions=Site administrators can use all of the designers; \
workspace and folder owners can use only the entry and workflow designers.
##
##   change config settings ####
##
help.configIntro.applyDefs.intro=To configure a workspace or folder, view the place, \
and click<br /> <span class="clickable_item">Manage this...</span> > <span class="clickable_item">Configure</span>.
help.configIntro.applyDefs.workspace=When configuring a workspace, you can inherit the workspace \
definition from the parent workspace, and you can select a default view. You cannot alter the \
default view of your organization's top workspace.
help.configIntro.applyDefs.folders.listIntro=You can establish these configuration settings \
for folders:
help.configIntro.applyDefs.folders.listItem.allowViews=\
<span class="def_list_term">Allowable views</span>--Users can select from this list.
help.configIntro.applyDefs.folders.listItem.defView=\
<span class="def_list_term">Default view</span>--The view when first visiting the folder.
help.configIntro.applyDefs.folders.listItem.defEntryTypes=\
<span class="def_list_term">Default entry types</span>--Types of entries a user can create.
help.configIntro.applyDefs.folders.listItem.workflowAssociations=\
<span class="def_list_term">Workflow associations</span>--Workflow processes \
that begin automatically as soon as a user creates the specified type of entry.
help.configIntro.applyDefs.folders.listItem.workflow=\
<span class="def_list_term">Workflows</span>--Workflow processes that you can apply \
to an entry while viewing it, using a drop-down list.
##
##   dedicated apps   ####
##
help.configIntro.dedicatedApps.intro=Using the designers, definitions, workflow, and configuration \
tools, you can create <span class="new_term">dedicated applications</span>. So, you can use \
an {0} folder as a platform on which to build a powerful application that maps to a business \
process in your organization.
help.configIntro.dedicatedApps.listIntro=Here are the general steps you can take to create \
dedicated applications:
#################################################################################################
#  TRANSLATORS: The letters "PTO" are easily recognizable in American English as meaning 
#               Paid Time Off.  Unless you are sure that an acronym translates equally in
#               the other language, I'd replace "PTO" with "paid time off".
#################################################################################################
help.configIntro.dedicatedApps.listItem.createEntry=Use the entry designer to create an entry \
to be used in your business process.  For example, if creating a "request for paid time off (PTO)" \
application, you probably need entry fields for a start date, end date, and manager's name.
help.configIntro.dedicatedApps.listItem.createWorkflow=Use the workflow designer to create a \
PTO process.
help.configIntro.dedicatedApps.listItem.testWorkflow=In a test folder, associate the workflow \
with the new entry, test it, and adjust your new entry and workflow process.  (Consider having \
users test the application before placing it in a production-ready folder.)
help.configIntro.dedicatedApps.listItem.createFolder=Create a folder, and configure it so that \
the only default entry is the new entry you created and associate the new entry with your \
PTO process. The application for this folder is "dedicated," because the folder \
contains only requests for PTO requests.
help.configIntro.dedicatedApps.listItem.allowedViews=Configure allowable views that make sense \
for your application. For example, because requests for PTO have begin and end dates, \
managers might find it useful to see a calendar view displaying all of their employees' requests \
in a given month.
##
##   templates   ####
##
help.configIntro.templates.intro=If you are a site manager, you can use the \
"Workspaces and folder templates" tool. As mentioned in a previous Help panel, you can alter \
default templates or create new ones.
help.configIntro.templates.hierarchy=The default templates establish configuration settings \
for a single workspace or folder; from the perspective of the workspace tree, the default \
templates configure a flat hierarchy (only one place). However, one of the most powerful \
features of the {0} templates tool is the ability to create a workspace-folder hierarchy. \
In this way, you can develop packaged hierarchies.
help.configIntro.templates.example=For example, let''s say that your organization wants most \
Team workspaces to contain two subworkspaces, a discussion, a file folder, and a blog. You can \
use the template designer to create this hierarchy of workspaces and folders. Then, when \
users create a Team workspace, they can select the template you created, and {0} \
automatically provides their new Team workspace with two subworkspaces, a discussion, \
a file folder, and a blog.
help.configIntro.templates.using=After accessing the template tool, click the \
<span class="clickable_item">Workspace</span> \
radio button, and click <span class="clickable_item">Add</span>.  Then, provide a title, \
description, and icon for your template. \
When you are viewing the "Workspace template: [your title]" page, there are two menus: \
"Manage this template," and "Manage this target." Use \
<span class="clickable_item">Manage this template</span> > <span class="clickable_item">Add workspace template</span> \
to specify the two subworkspaces in our example scenario. Use \
<span class="clickable_item">Manage this target</span> to set access control, configure \
the place, or modify the title, description, or icon.
help.configIntro.templates.moreUsing=As you add workspace and folder templates, notice that \
{0} displays a workspace tree just below the menus. Use this tree to navigate to \
subworkspaces and folders in the template hierarchy. For example, you need to navigate to \
a subworkspace in the template to add a subworkspace or folder in that place in the templated \
hierarchy.

the right to perform which tasks in which places. By default, everyone has the right to \
participate in every Global workspace and folder, visit all personal workspaces (read \
and comment about entries), create team workspaces, and participate in any team workspaces \
in which they are a member.  The general steps for altering access \
control is to visit a place in {0}, click the <span class="clickable_item">Access control</span> button, \
and use the "Configure access control" page to alter the default settings.
help.accessIntro.content.roles={0} uses <span class="new_term">role-based access control</span>. \
With this method, by default, {0} assigns a <span class="new_term">role</span> name to six sets of tasks. \
If you want people to be able to perform the associated set of tasks, you assign the role to them.
help.accessIntro.content.inheritance=By default, places inherit the access settings of their \
parent. So, by establishing settings for a primary space, all subplaces apply the \
same settings automatically, saving administration time. To specify settings separate from \
the parent, visit the place, view the access table, turn off inheritance, click either \
<span class="clickable_item">Add a group</span> or <span class="clickable_item">Add a user</span>, \
and remove and add checks as needed.
help.accessIntro.content.multiplePlaces=To alter access-control settings in multiple places, \
view and use any "Configure access control" page, and click the title of place in the workspace \
tree toward the top of the page. {0} then displays the access-control table for the new place. \
Repeat as often as needed.

##
##   default ACL users and roles    ####
##
help.accessIntro.usersGroups.listIntro.users=Here are the default users and groups located \
in the "Configure access control" tables:
help.accessIntro.usersGroups.listItem.owner=\
<span class="def_list_term">Owner of workspace or folder</span>--The person who created it, \
or the person assigned to be the owner.
help.accessIntro.usersGroups.listItem.teamMembers=\
<span class="def_list_term">Team members</span>--Those designated the status of team member \
in a given place, using the <span class="clickable_item">Team</span> > \
<span class="clickable_item">Add or delete team members</span> menu item.
help.accessIntro.usersGroups.listItem.allUsers=\

help.accessIntro.usersGroups.listIntro.roles=Here are the default roles:
help.accessIntro.usersGroups.listItem.visitor=\
<span class="def_list_term">Visitor</span>--Has read- and comment-only access.
help.accessIntro.usersGroups.listItem.participant=\
<span class="def_list_term">Participant</span>--Can create and modify entries (plus \

help.accessIntro.usersGroups.listItem.workspaceCreator=\
<span class="def_list_term">Workspace creator</span>--Can create subworkspaces (in root Team workspaces, \
allows users to create their own team workspaces).
##
##   default ACL delegating    ####
##
help.accessIntro.delegating.intro=As the number of Global workspaces and folders grow, it becomes impractical \
to have the same people manage all places in the workspace hierarchy. For this reason, you \
might want to delegate the administration of workspaces or folders.
help.accessIntro.delegating.howTo=Generally, create a group with the names of the people to whom you \
would like to delegate workspace or folder management (if there is more than one person). Add the \
group to the access-control table using the <span class="clickable_item">Add group</span> \
link (on the left side of the table). {0} adds a row for the newly added group or user.  \
Finally, add a check in the "Workspace and folder administration" column.
help.accessIntro.delegating.limitedAdmin=It is possible that you want to limit the privileges that \
you assign to the administrators of a workspace or folder. (For example, you might not want them to be \
able to delete the place.) In this case, you might want to create a new role (for example, "Moderator"), \
which includes only some of the rights granted to someone in the "Workspace and folder administration" \
role.
##
##   default ACL defining roles    ####
##
help.accessIntro.defRoles.intro=If you find that the existing roles do not meet the needs of your \
organization, you can modify existing ones or create new ones. This can be particularly useful if \
you want to delegate the administration of subworkspaces and subfolders, and if you do not want to \
grant all of the privileges that come with the "Workspace and folder administration" role.
help.accessIntro.defRoles.howTo=Generally, sign in as a site administrator, and click the \
<span class="clickable_item">Configure role definitions</span> link in the administration portlet. \
On the "Configure roles" page, provide a name for the new role, click check boxes next to the tasks \
you want members of this role to be able to perform, and click <span class="clickable_item">Add</span>. \
Then, navigate to the place where you want to apply the new role, click the \
<span class="clickable_item">Access control</span> button, click the \
<span class="clickable_item">Add a role</span> link at the top of the \
table, and click the role on the drop-down that you want to apply to this table.  {0} then adds \
a new table column for the new role. Remove and add people, groups, and checks as needed.

##############            WORKFLOW OVERVIEW   ######################
#########################################################################
##
##   Basic workflow definitions    ####
##
help.workflowIntro.title=Workflow overview
help.workflowIntro.content.businessProcesses=All organizations define \
<span class="new_term">business processes</span>, which \
establish a structured set of tasks that achieve a specific goal.  A few examples of business \
processes are: ordering office supplies, hiring new employees, requesting paid time off, and \
getting expense reimbursements.
help.workflowIntro.content.tasks=<span class="new_term">Tasks</span> in a business process \
can be independent or dependent upon \
other tasks.  An example of a dependent task is one that first requires management sign off. Also, \
tasks can be performed by members of your organization or can be performed automatically (for \
example, an amount of time expiring).
help.workflowIntro.content.status=Before, during, or after task completion, someone might report the \
status of the work, and the status determines who next must work on the item.  Examples of status \
labels include "begun," "assigned," "on hold," "needing approval," "Completed," and so on.  
help.workflowIntro.content.workflowDef=A <span class="new_term">workflow process</span> \
is an online version of a business process.  A workflow process enables people \
to automate, record the history of, and track all aspects of the business process.  To \
create a workflow process, use the "Workflow designer" in the administration portlet, \
and then use the {0} configuration tools either to have the process starts automatically \
any time a user creates such an entry ("associating") or to allow users to start the \
process "manually" when viewing any type of entry.
help.workflowIntro.subtopic.moreDefs=More workflow definitions
help.workflowIntro.subtopic.example=Conceptual example
help.workflowIntro.subtopic.associatingWorkflows=Associating workflow processes

##
##   More workflow definitions    ####
##
help.workflowIntro.moreDefs.content.state=A <span class="new_term">workflow state</span> is a label that \
identifies the result of a completed task and indicates who is responsible for performing a subsequent \
task (if any).  A <span class="new_term">state transition</span> occurs when one or more \
discrete <span class="new_term">conditions</span> are met.  Depending on conditions that are \
met, a state can transition to one of potentially many subsequent states.
help.workflowIntro.moreDefs.content.accessControl=\
<span class="new_term">Access control</span> identifies \
which users have the right to perform specific tasks at each state within the workflow process.
help.workflowIntro.moreDefs.content.question=A <span class="new_term">workflow question</span><sup><span class="ss_largerprint">*</span></sup> \
allows the workflow process to use a set of answers to determine whether and how an entry \
should transition. 
help.workflowIntro.moreDefs.content.notifications=A <span class="new_term">notification</span> is either an \
e-mail message or an instant message sent to a set of people (specified in the access control settings) \
upon state transition.
help.workflowIntro.moreDefs.content.parallelThread=\
A <span class="new_term">parallel thread</span> <sup><span class="ss_largerprint">*</span></sup> is a \
somewhat independent subprocess of the workflow, whose transitions proceed at the same time as those \
of the main workflow. A state in the main workflow initiates the parallel thread, and another state \
further along waits for one or more parallel processes to end before transitions in the main workflow \
continue.
help.workflowIntro.moreDefs.content.dedicatedApp=A <span class="new_term">dedicated application</span> is a \
folder whose only entry type is potentially custom designed and associated with a workflow process. \
This folder has only one type of entry, and the work is highly focused.

##
##   workflow Example    ####
##
help.workflowIntro.example.content.listIntro=Use {0} workflow to create a paid-time-off process:
help.workflowIntro.example.listItem.submit=Any employee submits a request for time off by \
creating an entry in a folder dedicated to this process.  
help.workflowIntro.example.listItem.submit.moreInfo=The entry form is custom designed, \
providing form elements for data such as "begin date," "end date," and "manager's name." \
The employee is represented internally in the workflow process with the label "entry creator."  
#################################################################################################
#  TRANSLATORS: The letters "HR" are easily recognizable in American English as meaning 
#               the Human Resources department  Unless you are sure that an acronym translates equally in
#               the other language, I'd replace "HR" with "Human Resources Department".
#################################################################################################
help.workflowIntro.example.listItem.submit.moreInfo2=Workflow access controls ensure that \
employees see only their own time-off requests, and that managers and Human Resources (HR) see \
all time-off requests. Automatically, the entry enters the initial state called Submitted.  
help.workflowIntro.example.listItem.managerQuestion=The manager receives a notification that one of her \
employees just submitted a time-off request.  She views the entry in the folder, and answers a workflow \
question<sup><span class="ss_largerprint">*</span></sup> that "approves" or "denies" the request.
help.workflowIntro.example.listItem.denied=If the manager denied the request, the workflow process \
sends a notification to the "entry creator," and the work enters the Denied state.
help.workflowIntro.example.listItem.approved=If the manager approved the request, the workflow process \
sends a notification to the HR department, and the work enters the Approved state.
help.workflowIntro.example.listItem.recorded=After HR records the time off in their database, they \
change the state of the work to Recorded.

##
##   Associating workflow with an entry    ####
##
help.workflowIntro.associatingWorkflows.intro=When you use the "Workflow designer" in the \
administrative portlet, the process is independent from any particular entry or folder.  \
To test and use your workflow process, you can use a folder-configuration form to allow the \
use of the workflow in the folder. This means that you can view an entry in the folder and \
can use a menu item to begin the process for that one entry.
help.workflowIntro.associatingWorkflows.associate=Most production-ready systems require that \
a workflow process start automatically once a user creates an entry. To enable this, you \
can associate the workflow with a particular type of entry, as follows:
help.workflowIntro.associatingWorkflows.listItem.viewFolder=View the folder that is to contain entries \
associated with the workflow process.
help.workflowIntro.associatingWorkflows.listItem.configureMenuItem=Click \
<span class="clickable_item">Manage this folder</span> > <span class="clickable_item">Configure</span>.
help.workflowIntro.associatingWorkflows.listItem.configureMenuItem.moreInfo=In the "Workflow associations" \
section of the form, {0} lists default entry types next to drop-down lists.
help.workflowIntro.associatingWorkflows.listItem.selectEntry=Select an entry type with which you want \
to associate a workflow process.
help.workflowIntro.associatingWorkflows.listItem.selectWorkflow=In the drop-down list, select the name of \
the workflow process you want to associate with the default entry type.
help.workflowIntro.associatingWorkflows.autoStart=Now, when someone creates an entry of that type in \
this folder, {0} automatically places the entry in the initial state of the workflow process.

## Admin portlet   ####
##
help.adminPortlet.roleDefined=By default, users are the administrators of their \
personal workspaces (and folders they may contain) and of any team workspaces they \
create. If you grant someone the right to manage the top workspace in the tree, then, \
by default, that person can manage all workspaces and folders in the installation \
(because all workspaces and folders inherit the setting). This person is allowed \
to create workspaces and folders, design entries and workflows, create groups, \
generate reports, re-index places (to improve search efficiency), and more. 
help.adminPortletSite.listIntro=In addition, site administrators can:

primary administrative tasks.
help.adminPortlet.createGroups=Finally, if you choose to develop a sizeable Global \

notifications established by the folder owner or administrator.

a "web feed" or "channel," is a way to subscribe to changing content. An RSS Reader \

web browsers provide a built-in RSS reader that you access from their menus. \
To subscribe to an {0} folder, click \
<span class="clickable_item">Subscriptions</span> > <span class="clickable_item">RSS feed</span>. \
These newer browers may present a form with a few questions for you to \

help.rating.explained=When viewing an entry, {0} displays yellow stars to indicate the average \
rating for this entry, with one star being the least favorable rating and five stars being \
the most favorable rating. If all stars are gray, then no one rated the entry yet.
help.rating.submitRating=To submit your rating, click a star (for example, to submit a \

help.webDAV.using=When you click \
<span class="clickable_item">View this folder as a WebDAV folder</span> in the footer toolbar, \

using WebDAV (it appears as the second icon in the set).
help.webDAV.login=Using WebDAV, you need to specify your {0} login name and password \

with two arrow heads, and drag it to the left or right to resize the column.
help.folderTable.listItem.sortColumn=Click a column header to sort the table in order for \

##
## wiki side bar  ####

a user must use the wiki sidebar to locate pages. If you want {0} to display an initial wiki \
page, then locate and display the entry, and click <span class="clickable_item">Set homepage</span> \
in the entry toolbar.
help.wikiControls.search=The wiki sidebar includes the "Find a page" text box, which uses the \
"type to find" feature. Using this text box, {0} lists wiki pages whose titles contain a \

"administration tasks", {0} lists the "Administration tasks" and \
"Delegating administration tasks" pages.
help.wikiControls.sidebar=The Navigation section provides a sorted list of all wiki pages. \
Click <span class="clickable_item">All</span> to sort the list alphabetically by title. \
Click <span class="clickable_item">Recent</span> to sort the list according to most \
recent activity (creation or modification).

##
## blog side bar  ####
##
help.moreBlogTools.intro=<span class="new_term">Blogs</span> are folders containing journal \
entries. The entries are presented in chronological order (most recent to oldest). Depending \
on access-control settings, people other than the author may comment on and rate blog entries.
help.moreBlogTools.sidebar=The blog sidebar provides tools for locating and viewing blog \
entries. Click a date in the calendar, and {0} displays the blog listing as it appeared \
on that day, beginning with that day''s entries and displaying all older ones; if you \
select a new month without clicking a date, be sure to click <span class="clickable_item">OK</span> \

every change to the blog entry), with or without attachments included.
##
## Date toolbar  ####
##
help.calendarTools.intro=The date toolbar alters how you view a folder that \
organizes its information according to one or more dates (calendar and task folders). \
Depending on the type of folder you are using, you might not see every tool.
help.calendarTools.tools.listIntro=This toolbar allows you to specify:
help.calendarTools.tools.listItem.countDays=That {0} should count only workdays or all \
calendar days.

folder page (1 day, 3 days, 5 days, 1 full week, two weeks, or a month).
help.calendarTools.tools.listItem.navigation=The next or previous folder page, using \

the arrows show you the previous or next three days of information.
help.calendarTools.tools.listItem.calendarApplet=The month or day to display, using the \
<span class="new_term">calendar applet</span>. This applet looks like a page from a \
hard-copy calendar, and you can click on the name of the month or the number \
of the day you want to view. After selecting a new month to view, be sure to click \
<span class="clickable_item">OK</span> to refresh the folder page.
##
## Entry date type  ####
##
help.calendarEntryControl.intro=This tool is particularly useful when you are using the \
calendar view to review information that is designed for another folder type. \
For example, you can use a wiki or discussion with its default view. Then, if the \
folder owner or administrator configured it to support this action, you could use the \
calendar view to see which entries had the most recent activity (for example, which \
entries have been most recently edited). You may also view entries according to \
creation date.
##
## tags  ####

help.tags.intro=Tags are keywords that categorize a workspace, folder, or entry. \
These categorical labels can assist you when using {0} search.
help.tags.types=A <span class="new_term">personal tag</span> is a keyword that only \

created the owner of a workspace or folder for use by everyone participating in \
that place. 
help.tags.creating=To create a tag, click the \
<span class="clickable_item">Tags</span> icon. In a text box, \

(<span class="clickable_item">X</span>) in the upper-right corner of the \
Add/Delete Tags panel to exit.
help.tags.syntax=Tags must be a single identifier, and you can use underscores (_) \
to separate words (for example, "marketing_plans"). You cannot use quoted phrases \
(for example, "marketing plans") or dashes (for example, "marketing-plans").
help.tags.deleting=To delete a tag from a workspace or folder or entry, \
view the item, click the <span class="clickable_item">Tags</span> icon, and \
click the Close icon (<span class="clickable_item">X</span>) to the left \

#  e-mail   #####################
ihelp.email.binder_name=This name provides a unique, "user-friendly" name for use when sending \
e-mail to a folder.
ihelp.email.digest_notify=Sends one e-mail message for every notification scheduled by the \
folder owner or administrator. The e-mail summarizes all creations and changes since your \
last notification.
ihelp.email.individual_notify=Sends one e-mail message for every new or changed entry in the folder.
ihelp.email.individual_notify_entry=Sends an e-mail message every time this entry is modified or commented on.
ihelp.email.disable_admin_notify=The folder owner or administrator can add your name to a \
distribution list, which sends e-mail notifications. Click this radio button to disable those \
notifications.

# e-mail settings for a folder   #####################
#######################################################################################
# The following strings are used in two jsps
ihelp.email.from=Consult with your {0} site administrator, ask for an e-mail alias, \
and specify the alias in this text box. \
An <span class="new_term">e-mail alias</span> is an alternative address for the \
one e-mail account that posts entries into this {0} installation \
(<span class="light_emphasis">incoming e-mail</span>). 
ihelp.email.from.restOfForm=The rest of this form applies to e-mail notifications \
(<span class="light_emphasis">outgoing e-mail</span>).
#################
#  Second JSP.  More on e-mail aliases
ihelp.email.from.moreInfo.topic=Understanding e-mail aliases
ihelp.email.from.moreInfo.intro=The person installing {0} specified two POP3 or IMAP e-mail \
accounts, both of which serve all folders in the installation: one used to send e-mail \
notifications from all folders (outgoing), and one used to post entries into all folders \
(incoming). 
ihelp.email.from.moreInfo.routing=For incoming e-mail, in order to route different messages \
within one account into various folders, {0} uses <span class="new_term">e-mail aliases</span>, \
which are alternative e-mail addresses for the one account. Aliases have the same format as \
any e-mail address, as follows:
#  Translators: Translate everything except for the "com" at the end.
ihelp.email.from.moreInfo.example=<span class="variable">name</span>@<span class="variable">company.</span>com
ihelp.email.from.moreInfo.explained=For example, the incoming account for the installation might \
be ic@yourcompany.com. You might have e-mail aliases such as ic.widget-team@yourcompany.com, \
ic.foobar-team@yourcompany.com, and so on. E-mail sent to any of these aliases goes to \
the ic@yourcompany.com account. When {0} routes mail from the account, it takes \
messages sent to ic.widget-team@yourcompany.com, and it posts them as entries in the \
"Widget Team" folder; it takes messages sent to ic.foobar-team@yourcompany.com, and it posts \
them in the "Foobar Team" folder; and so on.
ihelp.email.from.moreInfo.consult=Consult with your {0} site administrator to receive an e-mail \
alias. (Site administrators might need to consult with the organization''s IT person \
in charge of e-mail accounts to request creation of an e-mail alias.) 
ihelp.email.from.moreInfo.deletedAfterRouting=Remember that, after e-mail routes to an {0} folder, \
the e-mail is deleted from the e-mail account.
#  More info is a global string.
############################################################################################
ihelp.email.incomingAddresses=When folder owners or administrators configure their e-mail \
settings to specify an alias address for posting into the folder, that configuration \
information appears in this column. Use this information to track existing aliases to the \
incoming e-mail account for the installation.
ihelp.email.enablePostings=Regardless of other settings on this page, you must check this \
box to enable e-mail postings as folder entries. E-mail aliases are used to determine which \
messages in the incoming e-mail account for the installation are routed to which folders.
ihelp.email.enableCheckBox=Regardless of other settings on this page, you must check this \
box to enable e-mail notifications for this folder. When you enable e-mail notifications \
for a folder, you enable notifications for all its subfolders, as well.
ihelp.email.notification_list=Folder owners can use this column of this table to create \
a list of people who receive notifications regardless of their personal e-mail-notification settings. \
People may use the <span class="clickable_item">Subscriptions</span> > <span class="clickable_item">E-mail notifications</span> \
menu item to stop notifications sent using these lists.
ihelp.schedule.repeat_hours=This number specifies the hour interval for e-mail notifications. For example, \
given the default beginning hour of 12 noon, if you specify 8 hours, then notifications are sent \
at 12:mm, 20:mm, and 4:mm. To send only at the beginning hour, leave this text box blank.
ihelp.schedule.at_hours=This number specifies the starting point for the "Repeat every hh hours" \
value. Use 24-hour format. (For example, 13:00 is 1 o'clock p.m.)
ihelp.schedule.repeat_minutes=Beginning at the specified "At minutes" value (by default, hh:15), \
specify how many minutes pass before another notification is sent. For example, given the default \
starting point of hh:15, if you specify 15 minutes, notifications are sent at hh:15, hh:30, \
hh:45, and hh:00. To send only at the beginning minute (by default, hh:15), leave this text box blank.
ihelp.schedule.at_minutes=This number specifies the starting point for the "Repeat every mm minutes" \
value.

#  designers   #####################
ihelp.designers.event=A scheduled appointment or notable occasion. You may restrict the \
event to be within a single day (for example, a staff meeting), or you may allow \
multiple-day events (for example, a conference).
ihelp.designers.icon=This item inserts the icon as specified by the item's current configuration \
settings.
ihelp.designers.radio_buttons=Use this element type when you want the user to choose only \
one item from several possibilities.
ihelp.designers.selectbox=Use this element type when you want the user to select from a \
list. You can specify whether the user is allowed to select more than one item in the list.
ihelp.designers.custom_jsp=You can provide JavaServer Pages (JSPs)--one for the form, and \
one for the view--instead of specifying elements using the "Form and view designers." This \
advanced level of customization allows features such as executing a web service call to \
a database to fill in a field. Pair the field with an HTML hidden field, which the JSP fills \
in, and the data can be stored in this application. For more information, consult with \
Support Services. 
ihelp.designers.divider=This places a one pixel line across the page.
ihelp.designers.expand_area=This creates a section that expands and collapses, when the \
user clicks on the right-arrow and down-arrow icons next to the element title.
ihelp.designers.source_data=Use this select box to choose a custom element whose value should \
be used as the entry title.
ihelp.designers.recur=Check this box if the event may happen more than one time \
(for example, daily, weekly, or monthly events).
ihelp.groups.data_name=This is an internal-use, database name. \
The first character must be an alphabetic \
character (a-z, A-Z). For the rest, legal characters are alphanumeric \
characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), hyphens (-), and underscores (_).
ihelp.designers.data_name=This is an internal-use, database name. Names for \
elements in one definition must be unique. The first character must be an alphabetic \
character (a-z, A-Z). For the rest, legal characters are alphanumeric \
characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), hyphens (-), and underscores (_).
ihelp.designers.selection_data_name=This is an internal-use, database name. Names for \
elements in one definition must be unique. The first character must be a lowercase alphabetic \
character (a-z). For the rest, legal characters are lowercase, alphanumeric \
characters (a-z, 0-9) and underscores (_).
ihelp.designers.form_button_alignment=Select whether the buttons should be aligned to the \
right or left on the page.
ihelp.designers.mark_as_inline=Specify that an item as "inline," if you want to put multiple \
items next to each other, left to right, on the page.
ihelp.designers.mark_as_title=The title is derived from a file name.  Choose the file data item to use.
ihelp.designers.places=This item displays a workspace tree with check boxes next to workspaces \
and folders. You can specify whether the user is restricted to selecting only one place, of \
if the user may select multiple places.
ihelp.designers.radio_string=Enter an identifying string to be displayed next to the radio button.
ihelp.designers.required=Check this box if the user should be required to supply a value before \
the form is submitted.
ihelp.designers.selection_string=Enter the string to be displayed in the select box.
ihelp.designers.storage_media=This field specifies where the uploaded files are stored.
ihelp.designers.title_field=The Title field must always be included in the entry. It appears only once, \
and it cannot be deleted.
ihelp.designers.timeZone_name=Enter the three-letter time zone name (for example, EST)
ihelp.designers.new_template=This feature allows you to test actual workspaces and folders \
before commiting to a template definition. After testing a workspace, folder, or hierarchy, \
click this radio button, click <span class="clickable_item">Add</span>, and specify the \
top workspace or folder of the place you want to use as a template.
ihelp.designers.current_templates=Click the linked name of the template to review its definition \
or to modify it. \
<p>Because a potentially large number of workspaces or folders may be based on the \
standard templates, be sure that changes to these templates benefit your users; consider \
creating a prototype of the proposed template, testing it, and gathering feedback from users \
before you make the change to a standard template.</p>
ihelp.designers.import_definitions=Be sure that you first import any definitions upon which the \
imported templates are dependent. For example, if you define a custom folder, and if the \
template includes an instance of this custom folder, then you must first import the \
definition for the custom folder before importing the template definition.
ihelp.designers.view_type=From the list of current view styles, select the one that most \
resembles and functions similarly to your new view.

#  workflow   #####################
ihelp.workflow.allMustMatch=By default, only one condition must be met for an entry to \
transition. If you require that all conditions must be true to cause the entry to transition, \
then check this box.
ihelp.workflow.parallel=Creates a set of states and transitions the execute at the same time \
as the states and transitions in the main thread. A state in the main thread initiates the \
parallel process, and another state in the main process can wait for completion of the \
parallel thread.
ihelp.workflow.on_entry=You can take action when a process enters into or exits from a state. \
For example, upon entry (or exit) you can send a notification, begin or end a parallel process, \
or set a variable. 
ihelp.workflow.trans_variable=You can make decisions based on the value of a variable that \
you set. Consider a process that sends e-mail notifications when it enters a state, the process \
reenters that same state later in the process, but you do not want to send the notifications \
more than once. Set up that first state so that it sends notifications only if the \
"sent notifications" variable is not true.
ihelp.workflow.condition=You can use this condition to base the transition on the value that \
a user specifies for a custom element in the entry.  For example, you can define a "priority level" \
element to a custom entry. When a user selects "priority 1," then the transition occurs.

#  other menus and tools   #####################
ihelp.other.advanced_search=After typing search criteria and clicking the \
<span class="clickable_item">Search</span> icon, scroll down to review the matching items \
listed in this column (if any). To specify more criteria, click \
<span class="clickable_item">More options</span> in the upper-right corner \
of this form, and scroll down to apply them. To save this search \
for later use, provide a name in the "Saved searches" section \
of the side bar to the left, and click <span class="clickable_item">Save</span>.
ihelp.other.global_accessories=Click this radio button if you want the specified accessory to \
appear automatically on every workspace and folder that you see.
ihelp.other.community_accessories=Workspace and folder owners can create \
<span class="new_term">community accessories</span>, which automatically appear when anyone \
views the current workspace or folder.
ihelp.other.graphic_constraints=The graphic is scaled to fit within the maximum width \
and height that you specify, without distorting the picture (the "aspect ratio" is \
maintained).
ihelp.other.select_template=Templates establish configuration defaults. Once created, you cannot \
change a workspace or folder template. Site administrators can use the "Form and view designers" \
in the administrative portlet to work with folder or workplace templates.
ihelp.other.view_type=Step 1: Select the type of entries your folder should contain. Step 2: Select \
one default view for your folder listing. Step 3: Select allowed views, which provide alternative \
organizational presentations of your folder listing. (Note that, by default, there are two views \
designed for discussion folders: a list [default] or a table.)
#######################################################################################
# The following strings are used in a jsp
ihelp.other.def_view_type.intro=Select the view whose look best presents your folder list or \
workspace. 
ihelp.other.def_view_type.folders=When choosing for a folder, consider the types of entries \
it contains. For example, a folder list of calendar entries is usually best presented \
by a calendar view.
ihelp.other.def_view_type.workspaces=When choosing for a workspace, you can select the \
default "Workspace" definition. If you want to track project tasks and milestones based \
on task completion, you can select the "Project management workspace" definition. Finally, \
when choosing for a team workspace, select "Team workspace root" for workspaces that you \
want to display the <span class="clickable_item">Add a team workspace</span> button. If \
your team workspace is organizational in nature and not intended to have team workspaces \
as its subworkspaces, select the "Team workspace" definition (which omits the button \
for team creation).
#######################################################################################
ihelp.other.def_entry_type=Select the types of entries you want to allow users to create in this folder. \
Site administrators can use the "Form and view designers" in the administrative portlet to \
create new entry types, which then appear in this list.
ihelp.other.workflow_association=A drop-down list appears for each "Default entry type" \
you selected in the previous section. When you use a drop-down list to select a workflow process, \
that process begins automatically whenever a user creates an entry of that type.
ihelp.other.allowed_workflows=When the user views an entry, that person can use the \
<span class="clickable_item">Workflow</span> > <span class="clickable_item">Start workflow: wf_name</span> \
menu item to start the process for that entry.
ihelp.other.filters=This form is nearly identical to the one used for Advanced searches. After  \
you specify search criteria, items that do not match the search criteria are not displayed in the \
folder listing.
ihelp.other.inherit_roles=To change the access control for this workspace or folder, click the \
<span class="clickable_item">No</span> radio button, click <span class="clickable_item">Apply</span>, \
and headers in left-most column of the table change. \
To add groups or users to the table, click either the <span class="clickable_item">Add a group</span> or \
<span class="clickable_item">Add a user</span> link in the left-most column of the table, and use the \
"type to find" feature to select an item; as you type, items appear that match what you have typed \
so far. Click a column header to view tasks associated with that role. Add and remove checks to adjust \
who may function in which roles. Finally, to adjust access control in another place, use the workspace \
tree toward the top of the page, click the link of another place in the tree, and the access-control \
page for that place appears.
#######################################################################################
# The following strings are used in a jsp
ihelp.accessControl.intro=Use this page to assign people or groups to roles for this \
workspace or folder. A <span class="new_term">role</span> is a set of privileges; when \
you assign someone to a role, they automatically have all the rights associated with \
that role. In the table that follows, role names serve as column headers. Click a \
column header (<span class="clickable_item">Participant</span>, \
<span class="clickable_item">Site administration</span>, and so on) to see a list of \
rights associated with the role.
ihelp.accessControl.defaultInherit=By default, workspaces and folders inherit access-control \
settings from their parents. Use this page only if you want different access settings.
#######################################################################################
ihelp.folderManagement.uniqueFiles=If you check this box, then some product features treat this folder \
as a file folder. For example, the upload-file applet creates new entries for unique filenames, and it \
creates new versions of attachments for files already existing in the folder.  
#######################################################################################
# The following strings are used in a jsp
ihelp.folderManagement.mirroredFiles.def=A mirrored folder is an {0} library folder whose \
files are located in an external system (either a directory in a file system or a \
folder on a SharePoint server). In this way, you can apply {0} tools (for example, search \
and workflow) to external files.
ihelp.folderManagement.mirroredFiles.serverFile=You need to work with a file located on the server to \
enable this feature.
#######################################################################################
ihelp.other.definition_family=Select the item type that is closest to the function of the item \
you are creating. People can use the family type when performing filtered searches.

ihelp.other.linksToEntries.intro=When composing the Description section of an entry, you \
can create a link to another entry in {0}.
ihelp.other.linksToEntries.invokeTool=In the Description section of the "Add entry" form, click the \
"{0} link" icon, located at the end of the second row of buttons in the HTML editor. {0} \
displays a window allowing you to specify the entry to which you want to link.
