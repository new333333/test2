## Understanding workspaces  ####
##  Source: jsp/help/portlets/get_started/understand_workspaces_folders.jsp
#The first two are combined into one paragraph
help.getStartedProduct.content.workspaces.intro=<span class="new_term">Workspaces</span> are starting \
places for individuals and teams who want to do a particular type of work. 
help.getStartedProduct.content.workspaces.defaults=By default, there are four \
organizational workspaces: the top <span class="page_item">Workspaces</span> workspace, \
and sub-workspaces entitled <span class="page_item">Global workspaces</span>, \
<span class="page_item">Personal workspaces</span>, and <span class="page_item">Team workspaces</span>. 
help.getStartedProduct.content.workspaces.defined=<span class="new_term">Global \
workspaces</span> is a container for information available to anyone in your organization. \
<span class="new_term">Personal workspaces</span> contains links to personal information \
(such as contact information, a personal blog, and more) for everyone in your organization. \
<span class="new_term">Team workspaces</span> contains team-specific work. \
Workspaces can contain sub-workspaces and folders.
help.getStartedProduct.content.workspaces.projects=Workspace owners can create a \
<span class="new_term">project management workspace</span>. Workspaces of this type \
typically appear in either the global or team workspace areas. They include tools \
for reviewing project milestones and the status of specific tasks.

## Understanding folders  ####
##  Source: /jsp/help/portlets/get_started/folder_types.jsp
help.getStartedProduct.content.folders.listIntro=At the workspace level, \
you can organize your work further using folders, which, in turn, can contain sub-folders. \

##
## Getting started  ####
##  Source: /jsp/help/portlets/get_started/teaming.jsp
help.getStartedProduct.getStarted.intro=To get started using {0}, click the \
<span class="clickable_item">My workspace</span> icon. Add a few pictures to your \
personal workspace, write an introduction, and add a journal entry in your blog folder. \
As visitors, other people can view your contact information and entries, and \
they can comment on entries. However, they cannot edit your entries or add new entries. 
help.getStartedProduct.getStarted.team=After experimenting with some of the tasks \
in the quick start guide, you can invite a few trusted people into your personal \
workspace in a more expanded role. For example, you can view your discussion folder, and \
use the <span class="clickable_item">Team</span> > <span class="clickable_item">Add or delete team members</span> \
menu item to specify names. Then, those people can create new entries in your folder, enabling \
a higher level of collaboration.
help.getStartedProduct.getStarted.teamWorkspace=If your team requires a larger, private workspace \
with more collaboration tools (for example, a team calendar, tasks folder, or wiki), then \
view the <span class="clickable_item">Team workspaces</span> page (or the workspace \
specified by your {0} administrator), click the <span class="clickable_item">Add a team workspace</span> \
button, and create your new team workspace. By default, only your team members can view and \
use this workspace.

##  Understanding teams
##   Source: /jsp/help/portlets/get_started/team_intro.jsp
help.understandingTeams.topic=Understanding {0} teams
help.understandingTeams.intro=Generally, a <span class="new_term">team</span> \
is a group of people working together to achieve a shared goal. <span class="new_term">{0} teams</span> \
provide you with a dedicated area in which to collaborate online, and in which to communicate quickly \
and easily with teammates.
help.understandingTeams.teamWorkspace=By default, all people using {0} \
can create a team workspace, which provides your team with a dedicated work area. \
After you create your team workspace, add as many sub-workspaces or folders (discussions, \
file libraries, wikis, blogs, and so on) as you need for your work.
help.understandingTeams.globalWorkspace={0} supports a second type of team that can be applied \
to any workspace or folder. One reason why this team is useful is because it is a quick way to allow \
a group of people to participate in a place (for example, adding people to a team in a \
personal folder allows those people to author new entries). Another application is \
to designate a group of people as serving in a special role in that place (for example, \
subject-matter experts or moderators). To create teams of this type, the owner of a \
workspace or folder can use the \
<span class="clickable_item">Team</span> > <span class="clickable_item">Add or delete team members</span> \
menu item to create that team and can use access control settings to grant additional privileges. 
help.understandingTeams.communicate={0} communication tools allow for quicker use \
among team members. For example, in a team workspace, if you click the \
<span class="clickable_item">Meet</span> link at the bottom of a workspace or \
folder, click <span class="clickable_item">Team members</span>, \
and click <span class="clickable_item">Start meeting now</span>, then {0} initiates an \
online meeting, using {1}, without you having to specify team names individually. Membership \
in a team also facilitates use of the clipboard, IM using {1}, and e-mail.

## Create teams: grant access   ####
##   Source: /jsp/help/navigation_bar/create_team_restrict_access.jsp
help.setTeamAccess.content.intro=In addition to participating team members, you might want to \
allow other people to visit your team workspace in a more limited capacity. For example, you \
can add people to the Visitor role, which restricts them to reading or commenting on existing \
entries.
help.setTeamAccess.content.listIntro=To grant visitor access to people:
help.setTeamAccess.content.listItem.viewPage=View your team workspace.
help.setTeamAccess.content.listItem.aclMenu=Click \
<span class="clickable_item">Manage</span> > <span class="clickable_item">Access</span> control. \
{0} displays the <span class="page_item">Configure access control</span> page.
help.setTeamAccess.content.listItem.noInherit=In the <span class="page_item">This folder inherits...</span> \
section, be sure that the <span class="clickable_item">No</span> radio button is selected. If it is not, \
select the radio button, and then click the <span class="clickable_item">Apply</span> button.
help.setTeamAccess.content.listItem.addUser=Click the <span class="clickable_item">Add a user</span> \
column header, type the first few letters of person''s first or last name, and then, in the drop-down list, \
click the linked name. {0} adds a row to the table for that person.
help.setTeamAccess.content.listItem.enableUser=In newly created row, select the box in the Visitor \
column. (If the Visitor column does not exist, click <span class="clickable_item">Add a role > Visitor</span>, \
located toward the top of the table.) 
help.setTeamAccess.content.listItem.repeat=Repeat the last two steps until you have added \
all desired visitors.
help.setTeamAccess.content.listItem.saveChanges=Click the \
<span class="clickable_item">Save changes</span> button.
# Click Close is a global string.

##
## Site administration notes   ####
##   Source: /jsp/help/portlets/get_started/site_admin_notes.jsp
help.createTeam.siteAdminNotes.content.intro=By default, people create teams that are sub-workspaces \
to the <span class="page_item">Team workspaces</span> page. If your organization is large, you might \
want to create a hierarchy within which people can create their team workspaces. For example, you \
might want to create sub-workspaces in the team area according to geography \
(North America, South America, Europe, Africa) or organizational function (Executive, Finance, \
Marketing, Sales, Engineering).
help.createTeam.siteAdminNotes.content.howTo=When implementing a hierarchy of team workspaces, \
be sure to change the configuration of the <span class="page_item">Team workspaces</span> page so \
that it uses the "Team workspace" definition (this removes the <span class="clickable_item">Add a team workspace</span> \
button). For any non-root sub-workspaces underneath, create them as workspaces, inherit parent \
access control, and then re-configure them to be team workspaces.  Finally, for the root \
workspaces (off of which users create their team workspaces), create them using the \
"Team workspace root" definition (which adds the <span class="clickable_item">Add a team workspace</span> \
button to those pages).
help.createTeam.siteAdminNotes.content.access=Also, you might want to alter the access control \
of the sub-workspaces so that people can create their teams only in the appropriate sub-workspaces. \
Creating group names ahead of time for organizational sub-groups can greatly facilitate this process.

# More info is a global setting
help.configIntro.subTopic.definitions=Conceptual overview
help.configIntro.subTopic.designers=Understanding designers
help.configIntro.subTopic.applyDefs=Applying configuration settings
help.configIntro.subTopic.dedicatedApps=Creating dedicated applications
help.configIntro.subTopic.templates=Using templates
##
##   Explaining definitions  ####
##     Source: /jsp/help/portlets/admin
help.configIntro.understandDefs.intro=To configure {0}, it is helpful to understand \
the design that supports objects in the user interface. First, consider various categories of \
objects. Generally, there are <span class="new_term">workspaces</span> and \
<span class="new_term">folders</span> (places), and <span class="new_term">entries</span> (things). \
Furthermore, there are <span class="new_term">personal workspaces</span>  \
and <span class="new_term">profiles</span> of contact information (people), and files \
<span class="new_term">attached</span> to entries (also things).
help.configIntro.understandDefs.subcategories=To support a specific collaboration purpose, \
each category can have sub-categories. Consider the folder category. To refine its purpose, \
a folder can be a discussion, blog, wiki, file, photo album, guestbook, and so on. 
help.configIntro.understandDefs.definitions=A <span class="new_term">definition</span> is set of \
elements that affect the content and appearance of an object sub-category. Continuing the folder example, \
the wiki definition establishes both the form used to create a wiki folder \
(called <span class="new_term">the form</span>) and contents seen when displaying a wiki folder \
(called <span class="new_term">the view</span>). 
help.configIntro.understandDefs.instances=Finally, consider the difference between \
a category (say, a wiki folder) and a created object that belongs to that \
category (say, "Acme company policies and procedures wiki"). When you direct {0} to \
create an instance of an object, it requires a set of default configuration settings to apply to \
the newly created object.
help.configIntro.understandDefs.templates=A <span class="new_term">template</span> is the \
set of default configuration settings used to create a new place (workspace or folder). \
A template includes a definition (the form and view used to create and display the object), \
default access control settings (usually set to "inherit from parent"), and often much more.  For example, \
templates for folders include default entry types (wiki folders should contain \
wiki entries), a list of allowable views (possibly presenting wiki data in a discussion \
table, or time ordered like a calendar), a default view (wiki folders should default \
to a wiki folder display), and more.
##
##   Using form and view designers ####
##     Source: /jsp/help/portlets/admin/config_designers.jsp
help.configIntro.designers.intro=Using the form and view designers, you can alter \
default definitions or create new ones. 
help.configIntro.designers.getStarted=To use these tools, click the plus sign \
(<span class="clickable_item">+</span>) next to <span class="page_item">Form and view designers</span> \
in the administration portlet, and then click the category within which you want to work.
help.configIntro.designers.listIntro={0} offers these designers:
help.configIntro.designers.listItem.entries=<span class="def_list_term">Entry designer:</span> Definitions \
for entries.
help.configIntro.designers.listItem.folders=<span class="def_list_term">Folder designer:</span> Definitions \
for folders.
help.configIntro.designers.listItem.profiles=<span class="def_list_term">Profile designer:</span> Definitions \
for contact information (alter using the <span class="clickable_item">Modify profile</span> button).
help.configIntro.designers.listItem.profileListing=\
<span class="def_list_term">Profile listing designer:</span> Definitions for the \
<span class="page_item">Personal workspaces</span> page.
help.configIntro.designers.listItem.workflow=<span class="def_list_term">Workflow designer:</span> Definitions \
for workflow processes.
help.configIntro.designers.listItem.userWorkspaces=\
<span class="def_list_term">User workspace designer:</span> Definitions for personal workspaces.
help.configIntro.designers.listItem.workspaces=<span class="def_list_term">Workspace designer:</span> Definitions \
for global and team workspaces.
help.configIntro.designers.using=When using the non-workflow designers, click the plus \
sign (<span class="clickable_item">+</span>) to expand the tree until you can see the view \
and form. Click a title of an element you want to modify or that is near the location of a new \
element, and then use the tools presented to the right of the tree to add, modify, delete, or \
move elements. To guide your work, the designer displays a preview of the form toward the bottom of the page.
help.configIntro.designers.restrictions=Site administrators can use all of the designers; \
workspace and folder owners can use only the entry and workflow designers.
##

##    Source: /jsp/help/portlets/admin/config_apply_defs.jsp
help.configIntro.applyDefs.intro=To configure a workspace or folder, view the place, \
and click<br /> <span class="clickable_item">Manage this...</span> > <span class="clickable_item">Configure</span>.
help.configIntro.applyDefs.workspace=When configuring a workspace, you can inherit the workspace \
definition from the parent workspace, and you can select a default view. You cannot alter the \
default view of your organization's top workspace.
help.configIntro.applyDefs.folders.listIntro=You can establish these configuration settings \
for folders:
help.configIntro.applyDefs.folders.listItem.allowViews=\

<span class="def_list_term">Workflows:</span> Workflow processes that you can apply \
to an entry while viewing it, using a drop-down list.
##
##   dedicated apps   ####
##    Source: /jsp/help/portlets/admin/config_dedicate_apps.jsp
help.configIntro.dedicatedApps.intro=Using the designers, definitions, workflow, and configuration \
tools, you can create <span class="new_term">dedicated applications</span>. For example, you can use \
a folder in {0} as a platform on which to build a powerful application that maps to a business \
process in your organization.
help.configIntro.dedicatedApps.listIntro=Here are the general steps you can take to create \
dedicated applications:
#################################################################################################
#  TRANSLATORS: The letters "PTO" are easily recognizable in American English as meaning 
#               Paid Time Off.  Unless you are sure that an acronym translates equally in
#               the other language, I'd replace "PTO" with "paid time off".
#################################################################################################
help.configIntro.dedicatedApps.listItem.createEntry=Use the entry designer to create an entry \
to be used in your business process.  For example, if creating a "request for paid time off (PTO)" \
application, you probably need entry fields for a start date, end date, and manager's name.
help.configIntro.dedicatedApps.listItem.createWorkflow=Use the workflow designer to create a \
PTO process.
help.configIntro.dedicatedApps.listItem.testWorkflow=In a test folder, associate the workflow \
with the new entry, test it, and adjust your new entry and workflow process.  (Consider having \
users test the application before placing it in a production ready folder.)
help.configIntro.dedicatedApps.listItem.createFolder=Create a folder, and configure it so that \
the only default entry is the new entry you created and associate the new entry with your \
PTO process. The application for this folder is dedicated, because the folder \
contains only requests for PTO requests.
help.configIntro.dedicatedApps.listItem.allowedViews=Configure allowable views that make sense \
for your application. For example, because requests for PTO have begin and end dates, \
managers might find it useful to see a calendar view displaying all of their employees' requests \
in a given month.

##   templates   ####
##     Source: /jsp/help/portlets/admin/config_templates.jsp
help.configIntro.templates.intro=If you are a site manager, you can use the \
<span class="page_item">Workspaces and folder templates</span> tool. As mentioned in a previous \
Help panel, you can alter default templates or create new ones.
help.configIntro.templates.hierarchy=The default templates establish configuration settings \
for a single workspace or folder; from the perspective of the workspace tree, the default \
templates configure a flat hierarchy (only one place). However, one of the most powerful \
features of the {0} templates tool is the ability to create a workspace-folder hierarchy. \
In this way, you can develop packaged hierarchies.
help.configIntro.templates.example=For example, let''s say that your organization wants most \
team workspaces to contain two sub-workspaces, a discussion, a file folder, and a blog. You can \
use the template designer to create this hierarchy of workspaces and folders. Then, when \
users create a team workspace, they can select the template you created, and {0} \
automatically provides their new team workspace with two sub-workspaces, a discussion, \
a file folder, and a blog.
help.configIntro.templates.using=After accessing the template tool, select the \
<span class="clickable_item">Workspace</span> \
radio button, and click <span class="clickable_item">Add</span>.  Then, provide a title, \
description, and icon for your template. When you are viewing the \
<span class="page_item">Workspace template: [your title]</span> page, there are two menus: \
<span class="page_item">Manage this template</span>, and <span class="page_item">Manage this target</span>. \
Use \
<span class="clickable_item">Manage this template</span> > <span class="clickable_item">Add workspace template</span> \
to specify the two sub-workspaces in our example scenario. Use \
<span class="clickable_item">Manage this target</span> to set access control, configure \
the place, or modify the title, description, or icon.
help.configIntro.templates.moreUsing=As you add workspace and folder templates, notice that \
{0} displays a workspace tree just below the menus. Use this tree to navigate to \
sub-workspaces and folders in the template hierarchy. For example, you need to navigate to \
a sub-workspace in the template to add a sub-workspace or folder in that place in the templated \
hierarchy.

help.accessIntro.title=Access-control overview
help.accessIntro.content.intro=<span class="new_term">Access control</span> is the method by \
which you specify which users have the right to perform which tasks in which places. By default, \
everyone has the right to participate in every global workspace and folder, visit all personal \
workspaces (read entries and comment about them), create team workspaces, and participate in any \
team workspaces in which they are a member.  The general steps for altering access \
control are to visit a place in {0}, click <span class="clickable_item">Manage > Access control</span>, \
and use the <span class="page_item">Configure access control</span> page to alter the default settings.
help.accessIntro.content.roles={0} uses <span class="new_term">role-based access control</span>. \
With this method, by default, {0} assigns a <span class="new_term">role</span> name to six sets of tasks. \
If you want people to be able to perform the associated set of tasks, you assign the role to them.
help.accessIntro.content.inheritance=By default, places inherit the access settings of their \
parent. So, by establishing settings for a primary space, all sub-places apply the \
same settings automatically, saving administration time. To specify settings separate from \
the parent, visit the place, view the access table, turn off inheritance, click either \
<span class="clickable_item">Add a group</span> or <span class="clickable_item">Add a user</span>, \
and remove and select check boxes as needed.
help.accessIntro.content.multiplePlaces=To alter access-control settings in multiple places, \

help.accessIntro.delegating.intro=As the number of global workspaces and folders grow, it becomes impractical \
to have the same people manage all places in the workspace hierarchy. For this reason, you \
can delegate the administration of workspaces or folders.
help.accessIntro.delegating.howTo=Generally, create a group with the names of the people to whom you \
would like to delegate workspace or folder management (if there is more than one person). Add the \
group to the access control table using the <span class="clickable_item">Add group</span> \
link (on the left side of the table). {0} adds a row for the newly added group or user.  \
Finally, select a check box in the <span class="page_item">Workspace and folder administration</span> column.
help.accessIntro.delegating.limitedAdmin=It is possible that you want to limit the privileges that \
you assign to the administrators of a workspace or folder. (For example, you might not want them to be \
able to delete the place.) In this case, you might want to create a new role (for example, \
<span class="page_item">Moderator</span>), which includes only some of the rights granted to someone \
in the <span class="page_item">Workspace and folder administration</span> role.

help.accessIntro.defRoles.intro=If you find that the existing roles do not meet the needs of your \
organization, you can modify existing ones or create new ones. This can be particularly useful if \
you want to delegate the administration of sub-workspaces and sub-folders, and if you do not want to \
grant all of the privileges that come with the \
<span class="page_item">Workspace and folder administration</span> role.
help.accessIntro.defRoles.howTo=Generally, sign in as a site administrator, and click the \
<span class="clickable_item">Configure role definitions</span> link in the administration portlet. \
On the <span class="page_item">Configure roles</span> page, provide a name for the new role, \

help.workflowIntro.title=Workflow overview
help.workflowIntro.content.businessProcesses=All organizations develop \
<span class="new_term">business processes</span>, which \
establish a structured set of tasks that achieve a specific goal.  A few examples of business \
processes are: ordering office supplies, hiring new employees, requesting paid time off, and \
getting expense reimbursements.
help.workflowIntro.content.tasks=<span class="new_term">Tasks</span> in a business process \
can be independent or dependent upon \
other tasks.  An example of a dependent task is one that first requires management sign off. Also, \
tasks can be performed by members of your organization or can be performed automatically (for \
example, an amount of time expiring).
help.workflowIntro.content.status=Before, during, or after task completion, someone might report the \
status of the work, and the status determines who must work on the item next.  Examples of status \
labels include <span class="page_item">begun</span>, <span class="page_item">assigned</span>, \
<span class="page_item">on hold</span>, <span class="page_item">needing approval</span>, \
<span class="page_item">completed</span>, and so on.  
help.workflowIntro.content.workflowDef=A <span class="new_term">workflow process</span> \
is an online version of a business process.  A workflow process enables people \
to automate, record the history of, and track all aspects of the business process.  To \
create a workflow process, use the <span class="page_item">Workflow designer</span> in the administration portlet, \
and then use the {0} configuration tools either to have the process starts automatically \
any time a user creates such an entry (called <span class="new_term">workflow association</span>) or to allow users \

help.workflowIntro.moreDefs.content.state=A <span class="new_term">workflow state</span> is a label that \
identifies the result of a completed task and indicates who is responsible for performing a subsequent \
task (if any).  A <span class="new_term">state transition</span> occurs when one or more \
discrete <span class="new_term">conditions</span> are met.  Depending on conditions that are \
met, a state can transition to one of potentially many subsequent states.
help.workflowIntro.moreDefs.content.accessControl=\
<span class="new_term">Access control</span> identifies \
which users have the right to perform specific tasks at each state within the workflow process.
help.workflowIntro.moreDefs.content.question=A \
<span class="new_term">workflow question</span><sup><span class="ss_largerprint">*</span></sup> \
allows the workflow process to use a set of answers by users to determine whether and how an entry \
should transition. 
help.workflowIntro.moreDefs.content.notifications=A <span class="new_term">notification</span> is an \
e-mail message sent to a set of people (specified in the access control settings) \
upon state transition.
help.workflowIntro.moreDefs.content.parallelThread=\
A <span class="new_term">parallel thread</span><sup><span class="ss_largerprint">*</span></sup> is a \
somewhat independent sub-process of the workflow, whose transitions proceed at the same time as those \
of the main workflow. A state in the main workflow initiates the parallel thread, and another state \
further along waits for one or more parallel processes to end before transitions in the main workflow \
continue.
help.workflowIntro.moreDefs.content.dedicatedApp=A <span class="new_term">dedicated application</span> is a \
folder whose only entry type is potentially custom designed and associated with a workflow process. \
This folder has only one type of entry, and the work is highly focused.

##
##   workflow Example    ####
##    Source: /jsp/help/portlets/admin/workflow_more_defs.jsp
help.workflowIntro.example.content.listIntro=Use {0} workflow to create a paid-time-off process:
help.workflowIntro.example.listItem.submit=Any employee submits a request for time off by \
creating an entry in a folder dedicated to this process.  
help.workflowIntro.example.listItem.submit.moreInfo=The entry form is custom designed, \
providing form elements for data such as <span class="page_item">begin date</span>, \
<span class="page_item">end date</span>, and <span class="page_item">manager's name</span>. \
The employee is represented internally in the workflow process with the label \
<span class="page_item">entry creator</span>.  
#################################################################################################
#  TRANSLATORS: The letters "HR" are easily recognizable in American English as meaning 
#               the Human Resources department  Unless you are sure that an acronym translates equally in
#               the other language, I'd replace "HR" with "Human Resources Department".
#################################################################################################
help.workflowIntro.example.listItem.submit.moreInfo2=Workflow access controls ensure that \
employees see only their own time-off requests, and that managers and Human Resources (HR) see \
all time-off requests. Automatically, the entry enters the initial state called Submitted.  
help.workflowIntro.example.listItem.managerQuestion=The manager receives a notification that one of her \
employees just submitted a time-off request.  She views the entry in the folder, and answers a workflow \
question<sup><span class="ss_largerprint">*</span></sup> that approves or denies the request.
help.workflowIntro.example.listItem.denied=If the manager denied the request, the workflow process \
sends a notification to the entry creator, and the work enters the Denied state.
help.workflowIntro.example.listItem.approved=If the manager approved the request, the workflow process \
sends a notification to the HR department, and the work enters the Approved state.
help.workflowIntro.example.listItem.recorded=After HR records the time off in their database, they \
change the state of the work to Recorded.

##   Associating workflow with an entry    ####

help.workflowIntro.associatingWorkflows.intro=When you use the \
<span class="page_item">Workflow designer</span> in the \
administrative portlet, the process is independent from any particular entry or folder.  \
To test and use your workflow process, you can configure the folder to allow the \
use of the workflow in the folder. This means that you can view an entry and \
can use a menu item in the tool bar to start the process for that one entry.
help.workflowIntro.associatingWorkflows.associate=Most production-ready systems require that \
a workflow process start automatically once a user creates an entry. To enable this, you \
can associate the workflow with a particular type of entry, as follows:
help.workflowIntro.associatingWorkflows.listItem.viewFolder=View the folder that is to contain entries \
associated with the workflow process.
help.workflowIntro.associatingWorkflows.listItem.configureMenuItem=Click \
<span class="clickable_item">Manage this folder</span> > <span class="clickable_item">Configure</span>.
help.workflowIntro.associatingWorkflows.listItem.configureMenuItem.moreInfo=In the \

help.workflowIntro.associatingWorkflows.listItem.selectEntry=Select an entry type with which you want \
to associate a workflow process.
help.workflowIntro.associatingWorkflows.listItem.selectWorkflow=In the drop-down list, select the name of \
the workflow process you want to associate with the default entry type.

notifications established by the folder owner or administrator.
help.manageSubscriptionsMenu.rss=<span class="new_term">RSS</span>, sometimes referred to as \
a Web feed or channel, is a way to subscribe to changing content. An RSS Reader \

To subscribe to a folder, click \
<span class="clickable_item">Subscriptions</span> > <span class="clickable_item">RSS feed</span>. \
These newer browers may present a form with a few questions for you to \
answer, and then the subscription is complete. Using this menu item causes older browsers to \
display tagged XML code on the page. If this happens, select and copy the web address (URL), \
and then paste it into your RSS reader (see your organization''s IT administrators for \
more information).

addition to the footer-tool-bar link, {0} enables another icon for uploading entry attachments \
using WebDAV (it appears as the second icon in the set).
help.webDAV.login=Using WebDAV, you need to specify your username and password \
for {0} several times when working with files. WebDAV requires several passwords for \
applications (your browser and {0}), and it might require a third login when accessing \
an individual file.
help.webDAV.login.note=<span class="note_header">Note:</span> While running the Novell \
software iChain or Access Manager (NAM) on your server, your users may still be required \

#################
#  Second JSP.  More on e-mail aliases. Links off of site e-mail admin and folder posting config.
#     Source: Same as the three files listed previously
ihelp.email.from.moreInfo.topic=Understanding settings for e-mail postings
ihelp.email.from.moreInfo.intro=First, work with your organization''s IT representative \
who is responsible for creating e-mail accounts used to post messages into {0} folders. You \
both must decide between providing distinct e-mail accounts for posting into folders \
or using a single account with multiple alias addresses. (Or using a combination of \
both methods.) 
ihelp.email.from.moreInfo.aliases=It is most common to use aliases. To implement \
this method, use elements in the XML configuration file (see the installation guide) \
to indicate that you are using e-mail aliases, and to indicate your e-mail account name \
and password. (The syntax of an e-mail account name differs depending on the type \
of e-mail sever your organization uses; it might or might not look like an e-mail address.) \
Give the alias address to the folder owner.
ihelp.email.from.moreInfo.aliases.example=For example, the owner of a Marketing \
folder requests an address for posting into the folder. Within the collab@acme.com \
e-mail <span class="light_emphasis">account</span>, your IT representative creates the \
collab.marketing@acme.com <span class="light_emphasis">alias</span> address. The \
folder owner places "collab.marketing@acme.com" \
into the posting-configuration form and leaves the password empty. All mail sent \
to the account using collab.marketing@acme.com is posted into the Marketing folder.
ihelp.email.from.moreInfo.accounts=Some systems require a separate e-mail \
<span class="light_emphasis">account</span> for each {0} folder that needs e-mail posting. \
To implement this method, in the XML configuration file, indicate that you are not \
using aliases, and specify null strings for the account name and password. Provide \
a folder owner with the account name and password, <span class="light_emphasis">both</span> \
of which are placed in the posting-configuration form.
ihelp.email.from.moreInfo.deletedAfterRouting=Remember that, after e-mail routes \
to a folder in {0}, it is deleted from the e-mail account.
#  More info is a global string.
############################################################################################
#  Source: /jsp/help/workspaces_folders/misc_tools/email_enable_posting.jsp
ihelp.email.incomingAddresses=When folder owners or administrators configure their e-mail \
settings to specify an alias address for posting into the folder, that configuration \
information appears in this column. Use this information to track existing aliases to the \
incoming e-mail account for the installation.
ihelp.email.enableCheckBox=To allow the sending of e-mail you must select this box. \
Subscriptions will be sent every 5 minutes if needed. \
The outgoing schedule applies to all digest notifications (which summarize changes to entries in a folder and its \
sub-folders)
ihelp.email.enablePostings=To enable e-mail postings for all folders in the installation, \
select this box and specify a site-wide schedule. Then, a folder owner must specify \
either an e-mail account name and password, or just an e-mail alias address. This information \
is used to determine which messages in the account are routed to the folder.

# Describes notification settings in folder config. used in jsp
#    Source: /jsp/help/workspaces_folders/misc_tools/email_notifications_folder_settings.jsp
ihelp.email.notification_list=You can specify a notification type and a list of people \
to receive e-mail notifications. Notifications provide detail about new or changed entries \
in your folder and its sub-folders. However, remember that people can use the \
<span class="clickable_item">Subscriptions</span> > <span class="clickable_item">E-mail notifications</span> \
menu to alter your settings; personal settings override folder settings.

ihelp.email.notify.understanding.topic=Understanding e-mail notifications
ihelp.email.notify.understanding.intro=A folder owner can select a type of notification and \
a list of people who receive the notification. People's individual subscription settings \
override those of the folder owner.
ihelp.email.notify.understanding.types=Available in folders only, \
<span class="new_term">digest notifications</span> are \
single e-mail messages that contain a summary of all new and changed entries in the folder \
since the last notification. {0} reviews recent activity at a schedule determined by \
the site administrator; if changes occurred, {0} sends a digest message. \
<span class="new_term">Individual notifications</span> are separate e-mail messages \
for every new or changed entry, and {0} reviews recent activity every five minutes. \
<span class="new_term">Text-messaging notifications</span> are individual notifications that \
are suitable for display as text messages; these text messages include only the titles of the \
new or changed entries. 
ihelp.email.notify.understanding.textMessages=To set up text-message notifications, \
view your personal workspace, click <span class="clickable_item">Modify profile</span>, and \
specify an e-mail address to which {0} sends the text-message notifications. Then, \
use the subscription form and its \
<span class="page_item">Message suitable for text messaging</span> select box \
to select the e-mail address you just placed in your profile.
ihelp.email.notify.understanding.users=People''s profiles can contain more than one \
e-mail address of any type (general e-mail, mobile, and text messaging). Also, \
{0} allows people to receive notifications at any number of e-mail addresses \
of any type. For example, a person can receive two digest notifications and an \
individual message: one digest going to a work address, one digest going to a \
home address, and text message notifications going to a cell phone address. \
When someone subscribes to a folder or entry, under each category of notification \
(digest, individual, text message), that person uses a select box to select any \
number of e-mail addresses. Finally, to turn off all notifications (including \
those sent by folder owners using distribution lists), a person must leave all \
select boxes blank and must select the <span class="page_item">Disable notifications...</span> check box. 
#########################################################################################
#  designers   #####################
ihelp.designers.attributeList=This item allows you to configure sets of attributes that can be \
applied to each entry in a folder. These sets of attributes are configured on a per-folder basis. \
Each attribute set has its own list of attributes. For example, you could have two sets: \
Priority and Color. Priority has the attributes of high, medium, and low. Color has the attributes of \
red, yellow and blue. The entries in this folder could then have priority and color attributes applied to them.
ihelp.designers.description_view_type=For folders such as blogs and photo albums, you can choose to \
always show the description of the top folder in the set. This keeps the page layout constant as you \
navigate between folders in the set.

ihelp.designers.custom_jsp=You can provide JavaServer Pages (JSPs)--one for the form, and \
one for the view--instead of specifying elements using the "Form and view designers." This \
advanced level of customization allows features such as executing a Web service call to \
a database to fill in a field. Pair the field with an HTML hidden field, which the JSP fills \
in, and the data can be stored in this application. For more information, consult with \
Support Services. 
ihelp.designers.branding=Use this element to add branding to workspaces and folders. When branding \
is specified for a workspace or folder, all of the children workspaces and folders will inherit \
this branding. You can include images and HTML in your branding.
ihelp.designers.divider=This places a one pixel line across the page.
ihelp.designers.expand_area=This creates a section that expands and collapses, when the \

characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), hyphens (-), and underscores (_).
ihelp.designers.data_name=This is an internal-use, database name. Names for \
elements in one definition must be unique. The first character must be an alphabetic \
character (a-z, A-Z). For the rest, legal characters are alphanumeric \
characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), hyphens (-), and underscores (_).
ihelp.designers.selection_data_name=This is an internal-use, database name. Names for \
elements in one definition must be unique. The first character must be a lowercase alphabetic \
character (a-z). For the rest, legal characters are lowercase, alphanumeric \

ihelp.designers.required=Select this box if the user should be required to supply a value before \
the form is submitted.
ihelp.designers.selection_string=Enter the string to be displayed in the select box.
ihelp.designers.storage_media=This field specifies where the uploaded files are stored.
ihelp.designers.title_field=The <span class="page_item">Title</span> field must always be \
included in the entry. It appears only once, and it cannot be deleted.
ihelp.designers.timeZone_name=Enter the three-letter time zone name (for example, EST)
ihelp.designers.new_template=This feature allows you to test actual workspaces and folders \
before commiting to a template definition. After testing a workspace, folder, or hierarchy, \
select this radio button, click <span class="clickable_item">Add</span>, and specify the \
top workspace or folder of the place you want to use as a template.
ihelp.designers.current_templates=Click the linked name of the template to review its definition \
or to modify it. \
<p class="ss_ihelp_para">Because a potentially large number of workspaces or folders might be based on the \
standard templates, be sure that changes to these templates benefit your users; consider \
creating a prototype of the proposed template, testing it, and gathering feedback from users \
before you make the change to a standard template.</p>
ihelp.designers.import_definitions=Be sure that you first import any definitions upon which the \
imported templates are dependent. For example, if you define a custom folder, and if the \
template includes an instance of this custom folder, then you must first import the \
definition for the custom folder before importing the template definition.
ihelp.designers.view_type=From the list of current view styles, select the one that most \
resembles and functions similarly to your new view.

#  workflow   #####################
ihelp.workflow.allMustMatch=By default, only one condition must be met for an entry to \
transition. If you require that all conditions must be true to cause the entry to transition, \
then select this box.
ihelp.workflow.parallel=Creates a set of states and transitions that execute at the same time \
as the states and transitions in the main thread. A state in the main thread initiates the \
parallel process, and another state in the main process can wait for completion of the \
parallel thread.
ihelp.workflow.process=Starts an independent workflow process.
ihelp.workflow.on_entry=You can take action when a process enters into or exits from a state. \
For example, upon entry (or exit) you can send a notification, begin or end a parallel process, \
or set a variable. 
ihelp.workflow.trans_variable=You can make decisions based on the value of a variable that \
you set. Consider a process that sends e-mail notifications when it enters a state, the process \
reenters that same state later in the process, but you do not want to send the notifications \
more than once. Set up that first state so that it sends notifications only if the \
"sent notifications" variable is not true.
ihelp.workflow.condition=You can use this condition to base the transition on the value that \
a user specifies for a custom element in the entry.  For example, you can define a "priority level" \
element to a custom entry. When a user selects "priority 1," then the transition occurs.
ihelp.workflow.remoteApp.variable=The name of a variable that will contain the results \
returned by the remote application.
#  other menus and tools   #####################
ihelp.other.advanced_search=After typing search criteria and clicking the \
<span class="clickable_item">Search</span> icon, scroll down to review the matching items \
listed in this column (if any). To specify more criteria, click \
<span class="clickable_item">More options</span> in the upper right corner \
of this form, and scroll down to apply them. To save this search \
for later use, provide a name in the <span class="page_item">Saved searches</span> section \
of the tools side bar on the left side of the page, and click <span class="clickable_item">Save</span>.
ihelp.other.global_accessories=Select this radio button if you want the specified accessory to \
appear automatically on every workspace and folder that you see.
ihelp.other.community_accessories=Workspace and folder owners can create \
<span class="new_term">community accessories</span>, which automatically appear when anyone \
views the current workspace or folder.
ihelp.other.graphic_constraints=The graphic is scaled to fit within the maximum width \
and height that you specify, without distorting the picture (the aspect ratio is \
maintained).
ihelp.other.select_template=Templates establish configuration defaults. Once created, you cannot \
change a workspace or folder template. Site administrators can use the "Form and view designers" \
in the administrative portlet to work with folder or workplace templates.
ihelp.other.view_type=Step 1: Select the type of entries your folder should contain. Step 2: Select \
one default view for your folder listing. Step 3: Select allowed views, which provide alternative \
organizational presentations of your folder listing. (Note that, by default, there are two views \
designed for discussion folders: a list [default] or a table.)
ihelp.other.define_simple_url=Set up a simple URL which can be used to reference this folder. \
Unless you are a site administrator, your URL must begin with either your login name or one of \
the pre-defined global keywords.
ihelp.other.branding.info=If you would like to add a graphic with text, try inserting a 2 column \
1 row table into the branding editing area.  Then place your graphic in the left cell \
and your text in the right cell for a really neat looking display.<br/><br/>  \
For best results, limit your image size to no more than 100 pixels in height.
ihelp.other.attributes.info=Type in the name of your Attribute Set and click on add. \
An Attribute Set box will appear.  Type in the name of each attribute (one at a time) and click \
on Save Changes.  To delete an attribute or the whole set, click on the relative checkbox \
and click on Save Changes.

# The following strings are used in a jsp
#   Source: /jsp/help/workspaces_folders/misc_tools/views_folders.jsp
ihelp.other.def_view_type.intro=Select the view whose look best presents your folder list or \
workspace. 
ihelp.other.def_view_type.folders=When choosing for a folder, consider the types of entries \
it contains. For example, a folder list of calendar entries is usually best presented \
by a calendar view.
ihelp.other.def_view_type.workspaces=When choosing for a workspace, you can select the \
default <span class="page_item">Workspace</span> definition. If you want to track \
project tasks and milestones based on task completion, you can select the \
<span class="page_item">Project management workspace</span> definition. Finally, \
when choosing for a team workspace, select <span class="page_item">Team workspace root</span> \
for workspaces that you want to display the \
<span class="clickable_item">Add a team workspace</span> button. If \
your team workspace is organizational in nature and not intended to have team workspaces \
as its sub-workspaces, select the <span class="page_item">Team workspace</span> definition \
(which omits the button for team creation).
#######################################################################################
ihelp.other.def_entry_type=Select the types of entries you want to allow users to create in this folder. \
site administrators can use the "Form and view designers" in the administrative portlet to \
create new entry types, which then appear in this list.
ihelp.other.workflow_association=A drop-down list appears for each \
<span class="page_item">Default entry type</span> you selected in the previous section. \
When you use a drop-down list to select a workflow process, \
that process begins automatically whenever a user creates an entry of that type.
ihelp.other.allowed_workflows=When the user views an entry, that person can use the \
<span class="clickable_item">Workflow</span> > \
<span class="clickable_item">Start workflow: <span class="variable">wf_name</span></span> \
menu item to start the process for that entry.
ihelp.other.filters=This form is nearly identical to the one used for advanced searches. After  \
you specify search criteria, items that do not match the search criteria are not displayed in the \
folder listing.
ihelp.other.inherit_roles=To change the access control for this workspace or folder, select the \
<span class="clickable_item">No</span> radio button, click <span class="clickable_item">Apply</span>, \
and headers in the left most column of the table change. \
To add groups or users to the table, click either the <span class="clickable_item">Add a group</span> or \
<span class="clickable_item">Add a user</span> link in the left most column of the table, and use the \
"type to find" feature to select an item; as you type, items appear that match what you have typed \
so far. Click a column header to view tasks associated with that role. Select and remove check boxes to adjust \
who can function in which roles. Finally, to adjust access control in another place, use the workspace \
tree toward the top of the page, click the link of another place in the tree, and the access control \
page for that place appears.
#######################################################################################
# The following strings are used in a jsp
#     Source: /jsp/help/workspaces_folders/menus_toolbars/access_control.jsp
ihelp.accessControl.intro=Use this page to assign people or groups to roles for this \
workspace or folder. A <span class="new_term">role</span> is a set of privileges; when \
you assign someone to a role, they automatically have all the rights associated with \
that role. In the table that follows, role names serve as column headers. Click a \
column header (<span class="clickable_item">Participant</span>, \
<span class="clickable_item">Site administration</span>, and so on) to see a list of \
rights associated with the role.
ihelp.accessControl.defaultInherit=By default, workspaces and folders inherit access control \
settings from their parents. Use this page only if you want different access settings.
#######################################################################################
ihelp.folderManagement.uniqueFiles=If you select this box, then some product features treat this folder \
as a file folder. For example, the upload-file applet creates new entries for unique filenames, and it \
creates new versions of attachments for files already existing in the folder.  
#######################################################################################
# The following strings are used in a jsp
#    Source: /jsp/help/workspaces_folders/menus_toolbars/mirrored_folders.jsp
ihelp.folderManagement.mirroredFiles.def=A mirrored folder is a library folder whose \
files are located in an external system (either a directory in a file system or a \
folder on a SharePoint<sup><span class="ss_largerprint">*</span></sup> server). \
In this way, you can apply {0} tools (for example, search and workflow) to external files.
ihelp.folderManagement.mirroredFiles.serverFile=You need to work with a file located on the server to \
enable this feature.
#######################################################################################
ihelp.other.definition_family=Select the item type that is closest to the function of the item \
you are creating. People can use the family type when performing filtered searches.
#######################################################################################
ihelp.forum_import.general=Browse for the file containing the entries that were exported from Forum.  \
In order to import more than just the title and description of the entry, you must build a custom \
definition with fields that match the names used in the Forum command.  \
The import process automatically imports the title and description \
of the Forum entries correctly.  If you create a custom definition for your entries, you can add \
fields with a name and type that matches the values of other data from your Forum entries.  Only the \
"Data name" needs to match the Forum name - the Caption can be anything.  In addition, \
several internal values from Forum are available with these names: forum_documentType, forum_lastActivity, \
forum_workflowModifiedOn, forum_createdBy, forum_workflowState, forum_modifiedOn, forum_closedOn, \
forum_modifiedBy, forum_createdOn, forum_category, and forum_private.  If your custom definition contains \
fields with these names, they are populated with the corresponding data from the Forum entries.
