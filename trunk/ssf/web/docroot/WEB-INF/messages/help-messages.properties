help.getStartedProduct.title=Understanding {0}
help.getStartedProduct.content.intro={0} provides a fun, efficient way to develop and share files, \
communicate with teammates while doing project work, locate valuable expertise, \
complete business tasks, and more.
help.getStartedProduct.content.tools={0} includes time-tested collaboration tools, such as IM chats \
(using the Zon program) and "posting notes and replies." It also includes more modern tools, \
such as blogs and wikis.
help.getStartedProduct.content.portal=The page you are currently viewing is called a portal page. \
{0} tools appear within sections on the page called portlets. The Help icon \
you clicked describes a part of the navigation portlet; use this \
portlet to view {0} workspaces and folders.  
help.getStartedProduct.content.whatToClick=Click the "My workspace" icon to see your personal workspace, \
or open the workspace tree ("Global," "Personal," "Teams") and click the title of a place you wish \
to visit. {0} leaves the portal page and displays the desired workspace or folder. \
To return to the portal page, click the "Home A1" link (upper-left corner of the page) or the \
left-arrow icon (upper right).
help.getStartedProduct.content.moreInfo=For more getting-started information:

##
## Understanding workspaces and folders   ####
##
help.getStartedProduct.content.workspaces.intro=Workspaces are starting places for individuals \
and teams that want to do a certain type of work. 
help.getStartedProduct.content.workspaces.defaults=By default, there are four types of \
organizational workspaces: your organization's top workspace, and the Global, Personal, \
and Teams workspaces. 
help.getStartedProduct.content.workspaces.defined=The Global \
workspace is a container for information available to anyone in your organization. The \
Personal workspace contains links to personal workspaces (contact information, a blog, and more) \
for everyone in your organization. The Teams workspace is a container for team-specific work. \
Workspaces can contain subworkspaces and folders.
help.getStartedProduct.content.workspaces.folders.defined={0} allows you to organize your work further \
using folders, which, in turn, can contain subfolders.
help.getStartedProduct.content.workspaces.access=Because of configuration and customization, \
your {0} administrator has a large impact on what you are allowed to see, how things look, and what you \
can do. Contact your {0} administrator for more information about locating places within the \
workspace hierarchy or about access to various places.

##  Understanding teams
##
help.understandingTeams.topic=Understanding {0} teams
help.understandingTeams.intro=In your organization, a team is a group of people working \
together toward a shared goal. {0} teams provide you with a dedicated area in which \
to collaborate online, and provide you with ways to communicate quickly and easily with teammates.
help.understandingTeams.teamWorkspace=For example, by default, all people using {0} \
can create a Team workspace, which provides your team with a dedicated work area. \
After you create your Team workspace, add as many subworkspaces or folders (discussions, \
file libraries, wikis, blogs, and so on) as you need for your work.
help.understandingTeams.globalWorkspace=It is also possible to be working in a place \
in the Global workspace tree and to discover that most of the work is being done by a core team \
of people. To grant that team unique privileges someplace in the Global area, ask the \
workspace or folder administrator to designate those people as a team. You can then \
negotiate with the administrator to determine the assignment of privileges.
help.understandingTeams.communicate=Regardless of access-control privileges, the \
{0} communication tools allow for quicker use among team members. For example, in a \
Team workspace, if you click Meet at the bottom of a workspace or folder, click "Team members," \
and click "Start meeting now," then {0} initiates a Zon meeting without you having to specify \
team names individually. Membership in a team facilitates use of the clipboard, Zon IM, \
and email, as well.

help.configIntro.title=Configuration overview
help.configIntro.content.listIntro={0} is highly configurable, which enables the creation of \
a collaboration space that best suits your organization. These are various categories of \
{0} configuration:
help.configIntro.content.listItem.initial=Initial--Enables minimal {0} functioning \
(examples include email scheduling and LDAP settings).
help.configIntro.content.listItem.prepopulation=Prepopulation--Creates \
initial workspaces and folders, determines access, and delegates the management \
of subplaces within the workspace and folder hierarachy. Be sure to get user \
input before creating the initial workspace hierarchy.
help.configIntro.content.listItem.placeEnhancement=Place enhancement--Selects \
appearance options for workspaces and folders.  In addition, you can create \
new types of places (site administrators only) or entries, or you can create workflow \
processes. 
help.configIntro.content.listItem.useEnhancement=Use enhancement--Establishes appearance \
settings (for example, a default color scheme), accessory panels for folders that are \
globally available to users, and more. 
help.configIntro.content.listItem.user=User specific--Establishes individual appearance \
settings that are persistent, determines how folder entries display on the page, \
establishes accessory panels, and more.

help.configIntro.subTopic.definitions=Conceptual overview
help.configIntro.subTopic.designers=Understanding designers
help.configIntro.subTopic.applyDefs=Applying configuration settings
help.configIntro.subTopic.dedicatedApps=Creating dedicated applications
help.configIntro.subTopic.templates=Using templates
##
##   Explaining definitions  ####
##
help.configIntro.understandDefs.intro=To configure {0}, it is helpful to understand \
the design that supports objects in the user interface. First, consider various categories of \
objects. Generally, there are workspaces and folders (places), and entries (things). \
Expanding the idea slightly, consider portal profiles and personal workspaces (people), \
and files attached to entries (also things).
help.configIntro.understandDefs.subcategories=To support a specific collaboration purpose, \
each category can have subcategories. Consider the folder category. To refine its purpose, \
a folder can be a discussion, blog, wiki, library, photo album, guestbook, and so on. 
help.configIntro.understandDefs.definitions=A definition is set of elements that affect \
the content and appearance of an object subcategory. Continuing the folder example, \
the wiki definition establishes both the contents of the form used to create a wiki folder \
(called the form) and contents seen when displaying a wiki folder (called the view). 
help.configIntro.understandDefs.instances=Finally, consider the difference between \
a category (say, "a wiki folder") and a created object that belongs to that \
category (say, "Acme company policies and procedures wiki"). When you direct {0} to \
create an object, it requires a set of default configuration settings to apply to \
the newly created object.
help.configIntro.understandDefs.templates=A template is the set of default configuration \
settings used to create a new place (workspace or folder). A template includes a definition \
(the form and view used to create and display the object), default access control \
settings (usually "inherit from parent"), and often much more.  For example, \
templates for folders include default entry types (wiki folders should contain \
wiki entries), a list of allowable views (possibly presenting wiki data in a discussion \
table, or time ordered like a calendar), a default view (wiki folders should default \
to a wiki folder display), and more.
##
##   Using form and view designers ####
##
help.configIntro.designers.intro=Using the "Form and view designers," you can alter \
default definitions or create new ones. 
help.configIntro.designers.getStarted=To use these tools, click the plus sign next to \
"Form and view designers" in the administration portlet, and then click the category \
with which you wish to work.
help.configIntro.designers.listIntro={0} offers these designers:
help.configIntro.designers.listItem.entries=Entry designer-Definitions for entries.
help.configIntro.designers.listItem.folders=Folder designer-Definitions for folders.
help.configIntro.designers.listItem.workflow=Workflow designer-Definitions for workflow processes.
help.configIntro.designers.listItem.profileListing=Profile listing designer-Definitions for \
Personal workspace pages.
help.configIntro.designers.listItem.profiles=Profile designer-Definitions for portal tools \
used to create new users.
help.configIntro.designers.listItem.workspaces=Workspace designer-Definitions for Global and \
Team workspaces.
help.configIntro.designers.listItem.userWorkspaces=User workspace designer-Definitions for \
personal workspaces.
help.configIntro.designers.using=When using the non-workflow designers, click the plus \
signs (+) to expand the tree until you can see the view and form. Click a title of \
an element you want to modify or that is near the location of a new element, and then use the \
tools presented to the right of the tree to add, modify, delete, or move elements. To guide \
your work, the designer displays a preview of the form toward the bottom of the page.
help.configIntro.designers.restrictions=Site administrators can use all of the designers; \
workspace and folder administrators can use only the entry and workflow designers.
##
##   change config settings ####
##
help.configIntro.applyDefs.intro=To configure a workspace or folder, view the place, \
and click<br /> "Manage this..." > Configure.
help.configIntro.applyDefs.workspace=When configuring a workspace, you can inherit the workspace \
definition from the parent workspace, and you can select a default view. By default, there is \
only one workspace view; if you choose, you can use the workspace designer to create new \
views. Also, you cannot alter the default view of your organization's top workspace, or the \
Global, Teams, or Personal workspaces.
help.configIntro.applyDefs.folders.listIntro=You can establish these configuration settings \
for folders:
help.configIntro.applyDefs.folders.listItem.allowViews=Allowable views--Users can select from this list.
help.configIntro.applyDefs.folders.listItem.defView=Default view--The view when first visiting the folder.
help.configIntro.applyDefs.folders.listItem.defEntryTypes=Default entry types--Types of entries a user can create.
help.configIntro.applyDefs.folders.listItem.workflowAssociations=Workflow associations-Workflow processes \
that begin automatically as soon as a user creates the specified type of entry.
help.configIntro.applyDefs.folders.listItem.workflow=Workflows--Workflow processes that you can apply \
to an entry while viewing it, using a drop-down list.
##
##   dedicated apps   ####
##
help.configIntro.dedicatedApps.intro=Using the designers, definitions, workflow, and configuration \
tools, you can create dedicated applications. So, you can use an {0} folder as a platform on which \
to build a powerful application that maps to a business process in your organization.
help.configIntro.dedicatedApps.listIntro=Here are the general steps you can take to create \
dedicated applications:
#################################################################################################
#  TRANSLATORS: The letters "PTO" are easily recognizable in American English as meaning 
#               Paid Time Off.  Unless you are sure that an acronym translates equally in
#               the other language, I'd replace "PTO" with "paid time off".
#################################################################################################
help.configIntro.dedicatedApps.listItem.createEntry=Use the entry designer to create an entry \
to be used in your business process.  For example, if creating a "request for paid time off (PTO)" \
application, you probably need entry fields for a start date, end date, and manager's name.
help.configIntro.dedicatedApps.listItem.createWorkflow=Use the workflow designer to create a \
PTO process.
help.configIntro.dedicatedApps.listItem.testWorkflow=In a test folder, associate the workflow \
with the new entry, test it, and adjust your new entry and workflow process.  (Consider having \
users test the applicaiton before placing it in a production-ready folder.)
help.configIntro.dedicatedApps.listItem.createFolder=Create a folder, and configure it so that \
the only default entry is the new entry you created and associate the new entry with your \
PTO process. The application for this folder is "dedicated," because the folder \
contains only requests for PTO requests.
help.configIntro.dedicatedApps.listItem.allowedViews=Configure allowable views that make sense \
for your application. For example, because requests for PTO have begin and end dates, \
managers might find it useful to see a calendar view displaying all of their employees' requests \
in a given month.
##
##   templates   ####
##
help.configIntro.templates.intro=If you are a site manager, you can use the \
"Workspaces and folder templates" tool. As mentioned in a previous Help panel, you can alter \
default templates or create new ones.
help.configIntro.templates.hierarchy=The default templates establish configuration settings \
for a single workspace or folder; from the perspective of the workspace tree, the default \
templates configure a flat hierarchy (only one place). However, one of the most powerful \
features of the {0} templates tool is the ability to create a workspace-folder hierarchy. \
In this way, you can develop packaged hierarchies.
help.configIntro.templates.example=For example, let''s say that your organization wants most \
team workspaces to contain two subworkspaces, a discussion, a library, and a blog. You can \
use the template designer to create this hierarchy of workspaces and folders. Then, when \
users create their team workspaces, they can select the template you created, and {0} \
automatically provides their new team workspace with two subworkspaces, a discussion, \
a library, and a blog.
help.configIntro.templates.using=After accessing the template tool, click the Workspace \
radio button, and click Add.  Then, provide a title, description, and icon for your template. \
When you are viewing the "Workspace template: [your title]" page, there are two menus: \
Manage this template, and Manage this target. Use "Manage this template" > "Add workspace template" \
to specify the two subworkspaces in our example scenario. Use the "Manage this target" menu \
to set access control, configure the place, or modify the title, description, or icon.
help.configIntro.templates.moreUsing=As you add workspace and folder templates, notice that \
{0} adds a breadcrumbs workspace tree just below the menus. Use this tree to navigate to \
subworkspaces and folders in the template hierarchy. For example, you need to navigate to \
a subworkspace in the template to add a subworkspace or folder in that place in the templated \
hierarchy.

##############            Access-Control Overview   ######################
#########################################################################
##
##   Basic ACL definitions    ####
##
help.accessIntro.title=Access-control overview
help.accessIntro.content.intro=By default, everyone has the right to participate in every \
workspace and folder. Access control is the method by which you specify which users have \
the right to perform which tasks in which places. The general steps for altering access \
control is to visit a place in {0}, click the "Access control" button, \
and use the "Configure access control" page to alter the default settings.
help.accessIntro.content.roles={0} uses role-based access control. With this method, {0} \
provides a role name to five sets of tasks. If you want a group or user to be able to \
perform the associated set of tasks, you assign them the role.
help.accessIntro.content.inheritance=By default, places inherit the access settings of their \
parent. So, by establishing settings for a primary space, all subplaces apply the \
same settings automatically, saving administration time. To specify settings separate from \
the parent, visit the place, view the access table, turn off inheritance, click either \
"Add a group" or "Add a user," and remove and add checks as needed.
help.accessIntro.content.multiplePlaces=To alter access-control settings in multiple places, \
view and use any "Configure access control" page, and click the title of place in the workspace \
tree toward the top of the page. {0} then displays the access-control table for the new place. \
Repeat as often as needed.
#  More info header is a global
help.accessIntro.subTopic.usersGroups=Understanding default users and groups
help.accessIntro.subTopic.delegating=Delegating administration
help.accessIntro.subTopic.defRoles=Defining new roles
##
##   default ACL users and roles    ####
##
help.accessIntro.usersGroups.listIntro.users=Here are the default users and groups located \
in the "Configure access control" table:
help.accessIntro.usersGroups.listItem.owner=Owner of workspace or folder--The person who created it, \
or the person assigned to be the owner.
help.accessIntro.usersGroups.listItem.teamMembers=Team members--Those designated the status of team member \
in a given place, using the Team > "Add or delete team members" menu item.
help.accessIntro.usersGroups.listItem.allUsers=All users--Every person registered with {0}.
help.accessIntro.usersGroups.listItem.superAdmin=Super administrator-Person designated in a file 
on the server to be able to perform any task in any workspace or folder.
help.accessIntro.usersGroups.listIntro.roles=Here are the default roles:
help.accessIntro.usersGroups.listItem.visitor=Visitor--Has read- and comment-only access.
help.accessIntro.usersGroups.listItem.participant=Participant--Can create and modify entries (plus \
perform visitor tasks).
help.accessIntro.usersGroups.listItem.teamMember=Team member--Is equivalent to Participant.
help.accessIntro.usersGroups.listItem.wsFldrAdmin=Workspace and folder administration--Can create, \
modify, or delete workspaces or folders; moderate participation (modify or delete the entries of others, \
and so on); design entries and workflows, and more (plus perform Participant tasks).
help.accessIntro.usersGroups.listItem.siteAdmin=Site administrator--Can use all designers (which create \
definitions), can create templates, and more (plus perform tasks from all other roles).
##
##   default ACL delegating    ####
##
help.accessIntro.delegating.intro=As the number of workspaces and folders grow, it becomes impractical \
to have the same group of administrators manage all places in the installation. For this reason, you \
might want to delegate the administration of workspaces and perhaps folders.
help.accessIntro.delegating.howTo=Generally, create a group with the names of the people to whom you \
would like to delegate workspace or folder management (if there is more than one person). Add the \
group to the access-control table using the "Add group" link (on the left side of the table). {0} \
adds a row for the newly added group or user.  Finally, add a check in the \
"Workspace and folder administration" column.
help.accessIntro.delegating.limitedAdmin=It is possible that you want to limit the privileges that \
you assign to the administrators of a workspace or folder. (For example, you might not want them to be \
able to delete the place.) In this case, you might want to create a new role (for example, "Moderator"), \
which includes only some of the rights granted to someone in the "Workspace and folder administration" \
role.
##
##   default ACL defining roles    ####
##
help.accessIntro.defRoles.intro=If you find that the existing roles do not meet the needs of your \
organization, you can modify existing ones or create new ones. This can be particularly useful if \
you want to delegate the administration of subworkspaces and subfolders, and if you do not want to \
grant all of the privileges that come with the "Workspace and folder administration" role.
help.accessIntro.defRoles.howTo=Generally, sign in as a site administrator, and click the \
"Configure role definitions" link in the administration portlet. On the "Configure roles" page, \
provide a name for the new role, click check boxes next to the tasks you want members of this \
role to be able to perform, and click Add. Then, navigate to the place where you want to apply \
the new role, click the "Access control" button, click the "Add a role" link at the top of the \
table, and click the role on the drop-down that you want to apply to this table.  {0} then adds \
a new table column for the new role. Remove and add people, groups, and checks as needed. 

#########################################################################
##############            WORKFLOW OVERVIEW   ######################
#########################################################################
##
##   Basic workflow definitions    ####
##
help.workflowIntro.title=Workflow overview
help.workflowIntro.content.businessProcesses=All organizations define business processes, which \
establish a structured set of tasks that achieve a specific goal.  A few examples of business \
processes are: ordering office supplies, hiring new employees, requesting paid time off, and \
getting expense reimbursements.
help.workflowIntro.content.tasks=Tasks in a business process can be independent or dependent upon \
other tasks.  An example of a dependent task is one that first requires management sign off. Also, \
tasks can be performed by members of your organization or can be performed automatically (for \
example, an amount of time expiring).
help.workflowIntro.content.status=Before, during, or after task completion, someone might report the \
status of the work, and the status determines who next must work on the item.  Examples of status \
labels include "begun," "assigned," "on hold," "needing approval," "Completed," and so on.  
help.workflowIntro.content.workflowDef=A workflow process \
is an online representation of a business process.  A workflow process enables participants \
to organize, automate, record the history of, and track all aspects of the business process.  To \
create a workflow process, use the "Workflow designer" in the administration portlet to create the \
process, and then use the {0} configuration tools either to associate the workflow process with an \
entry type (the process starts automatically any time a user creates such an entry) or to allow \
users to start the process when viewing any type of entry.
help.workflowIntro.subtopic.moreDefs=More workflow definitions
help.workflowIntro.subtopic.example=Conceptual example
help.workflowIntro.subtopic.associatingWorkflows=Associating workflow processes

##
##   More workflow definitions    ####
##
help.workflowIntro.moreDefs.content.state=A workflow state is a label that \
identifies the result of a completed task and indicates who is responsible for performing a subsequent \
task (if any).  A state transition occurs when one or more \
discrete conditions are met.  Depending on conditions that are \
met, a state can transition to one of potentially many subsequent states.
help.workflowIntro.moreDefs.content.accessControl=Access control identifies \
which users have the right to perform specific tasks at each state within the workflow process.
help.workflowIntro.moreDefs.content.question=A workflow question allows \
the workflow process to use a set of answers to determine whether and how an entry should transition.  \
Questions can be specific to one state or globally accessible to all states.
help.workflowIntro.moreDefs.content.notifications=A notification is either an \
email message or an IM sent to a set of people (specified in the access control settings) when an entry \
transitions either into or out of a state.
help.workflowIntro.moreDefs.content.parallelThread=A parallel thread is a \
somewhat independent subprocess of the workflow, whose transitions proceed at the same time as those \
of the main workflow. A state in the main workflow initiates the parallel thread, and another state \
further along waits for one or more parallel processes to end before transitions in the main workflow \
continue.
help.workflowIntro.moreDefs.content.dedicatedApp=A dedicated application is a \
folder whose only entry type is potentially custom designed and associated with a workflow process. \
The effect is that users of the folder add only one type of entry, and the work done in the folder \
is highly focused.

##
##   workflow Example    ####
##
help.workflowIntro.example.content.listIntro=This step list outlines a paid-time-off business process \
that you represent using an {0} workflow process:
help.workflowIntro.example.listItem.submit=Any employee submits a request for time off by \
creating an entry in a folder dedicated to this process.  
help.workflowIntro.example.listItem.submit.moreInfo=The entry form is custom designed, \
providing form elements for data such as "begin date," "end date," and "manager's name." \
The employee is represented internally in the workflow process with the label "entry creator."  
#################################################################################################
#  TRANSLATORS: The letters "HR" are easily recognizable in American English as meaning 
#               the Human Resources department  Unless you are sure that an acronym translates equally in
#               the other language, I'd replace "HR" with "Human Resources Department".
#################################################################################################
help.workflowIntro.example.listItem.submit.moreInfo2=Workflow access controls ensure that \
employees see only their own time-off requests, and that managers and Human Resources (HR) see \
all time-off requests. Automatically, the entry enters the intial state called Submitted.  
help.workflowIntro.example.listItem.managerQuestion=The manager receives a notification that one of her \
employees just submitted a time-off request.  She views the entry in the folder, and answers a workflow \
question that "approves" or "denies" the request.
help.workflowIntro.example.listItem.denied=If the manager denied the request, the workflow process \
sends a notification to the "entry creator," and the work enters the Denied state.
help.workflowIntro.example.listItem.approved=If the manager approved the request, the workflow process \
sends a notification to the HR department, and the work enters the Approved state.
help.workflowIntro.example.listItem.recorded=After HR records the time off in their database, they \
change the state of the work to Recorded.

##
##   Associating workflow with an entry    ####
##
help.workflowIntro.associatingWorkflows.intro=When you use the "Workflow designer" in the \
administrative portlet, the process is independent from any particular entry or folder.  \
To test and use your workflow process, you can use a folder-configuration form to allow the \
use of the workflow in the folder. This means that you can view an entry in the folder and \
can use a menu item to begin the process for that one entry.
help.workflowIntro.associatingWorkflows.associate=Most production-ready systems require that \
a workflow process start automatically once a user creates an entry. To enable this, you \
can associate the workflow with a particular type of entry, as follows:
help.workflowIntro.associatingWorkflows.listIntro=To associate a workflow process with an entry type, \
do the following:
help.workflowIntro.associatingWorkflows.listItem.viewFolder=View the folder that is to contain entries \
associated with the workflow process.
help.workflowIntro.associatingWorkflows.listItem.configureMenuItem=Click \
"Manage this folder" > Configure.
help.workflowIntro.associatingWorkflows.listItem.configureMenuItem.moreInfo=In the "Workflow associations" \
section of the form, {0} lists default entry types next to drop-down lists.
help.workflowIntro.associatingWorkflows.listItem.selectEntry=Select an entry type with which you want \
to associate a workflow process.
help.workflowIntro.associatingWorkflows.listItem.selectWorkflow=In the drop-down list, select the name of \
the workflow process you want to associate with the default entry type.
help.workflowIntro.associatingWorkflows.autoStart=Now, when someone creates an entry of that type in \
this folder, {0} automatically places the entry in the initial state of the associated process.
