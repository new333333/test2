	 * the module method.
	 * <p>
	 * Pre-event method takes exactly the same set of arguments and in the same 
	 * order as the module method. The return type for pre-event method is typially 
	 * <code>void</code>. But it can optionally define a return type of 
	 * <code>boolean</code> and make a decision at runtime as to whether the chain
	 * of execution should proceed or stop by returning <code>true</code> or
	 * <code>false</code> respectively. The way in which the system handles aborted
	 * execution depends on the nature and the return type of the corresponding
	 * module method. For example, if the module method is designed to return
	 * nothing, stopped processing of the chain may not be immediately noticeable.
	 * However, if the module method is designed to return non-null object all the
	 * time, then aborted execution of the pipeline may result in an exception 
	 * (eg. NullPointerException) because the pipeline is not returning the value
	 * that the application layer is expecting. It is up to the descretion of the
	 * person who develops or plugs in the listener to decide what makes or does
	 * not make sense on a per case basis.

	 * With this post-event method, each listener can post-process an execution, 
	 * getting applied in inverse order of the execution chain. The post-event 
	 * method is invoked ONLY IF the earlier execution of the module method 
	 * returned successfully.
	 * <p>
	 * Post-event method takes exactly the same set of arguments and in the same
	 * order as the module method. However, if the return type of the module method
	 * is anything but <code>void</code>, an extra argument with the same type as
	 * the return type of the module method MUST be appended to the argument list
	 * (eg. see the last argument of type <code>FolderEntry</code> in the argument
	 * list below). At runtime, the system takes the return value from the successful
	 * execution of the module method, and passes it to the post-event method so
	 * that the listener can make use of the value if needed. This mechanism works
	 * for return values of both object (eg. FolderEntry) and primitive types 
	 * (eg. boolean). However, if the return type of the module method is 
	 * <code>void</code>, this extra argument MUST NOT be specified in the signature
