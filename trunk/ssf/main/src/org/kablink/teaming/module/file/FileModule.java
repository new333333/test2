/**
 * Provides uniform interface and integrated management for various file 
 * resources in the system hiding the details of the actual repository
 * systems from the caller. Provides higher-level wrapper around underlying
 * repository system implementations and adds metadata management which
 * may require database transaction support.   
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: Although most of the methods defined in this module take
 * binder and entity/entry as arguments, they are used primarily to 
 * construct full path to file resource. In other words, the focus of
 * the operations is files not binders or entries. For that reason, this
 * module does NOT perform any access-control because files are NOT
 * access-controlled objects themselves. Instead, access control is enforced
 * by their enclosing entries. Therefore, when implementing an application
 * feature using the services provided by this module, it is important
 * for the feature implementation to perform appropriate access checking
 * either by first calling another module that does the access checking
 * or by wrapping invocation of FileModule methods within another higher-level 
 * module and calling the method in the wrapper.
