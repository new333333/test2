 * A job that runs on a periodic basis to collect and send telemetry data.
 * <p>
 * This job differs from most other jobs in the system in that this job runs in 
 * the context of the default zone, yet performs operations that span the entire
 * site across all zones. In other word, this is a global-scoped job. 
 * Consequently, it is crucial to refrain from creating multiple instances of 
 * this job for different zones.
