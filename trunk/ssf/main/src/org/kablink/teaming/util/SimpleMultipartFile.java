	 * is always computable. This particular implementation extends the
	 * semantics by allowing for return value of -1 (or any negative 
	 * long value) to indicate to the caller that the size is unknown.
	 * In purely OO sense, this is a violation of the contract defined
	 * by the interface, hence very bad programming practice that should be
	 * avoided whenever possible. However, the cost of avoiding this
	 * hack is too high for our project. So I think it justifies this
	 * small wrinkle (we are not living in an ideal world).
