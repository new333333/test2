/**
 * The main runtime interface between application and Lucene service. 
 * <p>
 * It is not intended that implementors be threadsafe. Instead each thread
 * should obtain its own instance from a <code>LuceneSessionFactory</code>.
 * <p>
 * Important semantics regarding the API:
 * <p>
 * 1) The API does not guarantee that changes made to the index through
 * a method call is flushed out to disk immediately. This implies that
 * the subsequent call may or may not see the changes made by the 
 * previous calls even when made through the same session. 
 * If the application requires the changes to be synchronized to disk
 * immediately, it must call <code>flush</code> immediately after the
 * operation. Then it is guaranteed that the next call will see the changes.
 * <p> 
 * 2) The API says nothing about when, how often, or under what circumstances
 * the Lucene service actually flushes changes out to the persistent store
 * OTHER THAN the fact that it guarantees synchronization when the application 
 * explicitly calls <code>flush</code> method. Other details are left to
 * the service implementation.
 * <p>
 * 3) There is no client-controlled rollback semantics supported.
