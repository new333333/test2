/**
 * This class extends com.bradmcevoy.http.ServletRequest to customize the behavior
 * around authorization object handling. Specifically, the Milton class assumes
 * that authorization object is obtainable only if the client request contains
 * an authorization HTTP header (e.g. with Digest or Basic). Otherwise, it returns
 * null, which subsequently causes problem with lock management. 
 * This class alters the behavior, and returns an appropriate authorization object
 * as long as the original HTTP request is authenticated and the user information
 * is available from it. So, this should be able to handle all authentication
 * scenarios (including pre-authentication and SSO), not just the ones that come
 * with HTTP authorization header.
