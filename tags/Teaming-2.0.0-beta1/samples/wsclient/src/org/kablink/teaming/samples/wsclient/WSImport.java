/*
 * Import workspaces, folders, entries and attachments exported by WsExport.  Each binder is a Windows
 *  folder, with an Attributes.xml file in it.  Attributes.xml contains XML whose root element has at
 *  least an 'id', a 'type', and a 'title' element.  The id is just used for displaying status, but the
 *  type and title are used to create the binder.
 * Within a binder's Windows folder, there can be entries in XML files.  Any .xml file that begins with a
 *  number will be taken as an entry.  The contents of the XML file will be sent as-is in the addFolderEntry
 *  call.  The definitionId in that XML will be sent as the definition ID, so it must exist on the target
 *  system before importing.
 * If a folder exists whose name matches the name of the entry XML file, but with "Attach-" at the beginning
 *  and with no ".xml" extension, each of the files within it will be uploaded as an attachment to that
 *  entry.
 *  
 * You may need to change three numbers in this file and recompile to use it on your system.  They are
 *  the values of the global variables GlobalWorkspacesId, WorkspaceConfigId, and DiscussionFolderConfigId.
 *  GlobalWorkspacesId is the binder ID of the "Global Workspaces" folder, under which a workspace to hold
 *  the imported data will be created.  You can set this to anything you like, not just the Global Workspaces,
 *  but it must be a workspace.  If you don't want to create a new workspace to hold the imported data,
 *  you can pass a binder ID on the command line, and the data will be imported there.  It must be a
 *  workspace ID, if the data to be imported has any workspaces in it.
 * The other two numbers are the "config IDs" for a vanilla workspace and a discussion folder.  You can
 *  find these numbers on your system by going to any workspace, and choosing "Add a workspace" or
 *  "Add a folder" from the Manage menu.  Viewing the source of this page, you can find the number
 *  associated with the radio button for each of the two binder types (workspace and discussion folder).
 *  You choose any of the folder types, not just Discussion Folder, but all imported folders will be of
 *  that type.
 *  
 * Besides the all-folders-are-of-one-type limitation, the other big limitation of this process is that
 *  all binders and entries created will be owned by a single user (admin, unless you change the log-in
 *  information in this file and the PasswordCallback).  Also, unlike WsExport, there is no capability for
 *  resuming an import that gets interrupted.  You'll have to just delete the partially imported stuff
 *  and start again.
