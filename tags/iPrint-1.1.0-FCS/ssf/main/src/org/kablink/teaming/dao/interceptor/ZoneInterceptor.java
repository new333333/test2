				// execute an SQL update). When that not-wanted flush works, we end up modifying
				// the record in the database (hence increasing the lockVersion) for no good reason.
				// When that doesn't work (almost always due to optimistic locking failure), 
				// the damage is even greater, because it causes the application transaction to fail.
				// For this reason, we're adding this hack(?) here and make the dirty checki decision
				// ourselves so that we can short circuit the bad scenario before it does damage.
				// From Hibernate point of view, there is nothing illegal about this, since they
				// added this hook just so that application can make the decision. But for us, it
				// still feels like a hack, since we're doing this without fully understanding WHY
				// this problem occurred for definition objects in the first place. If this can be
				// any comfort, we plan on getting rid of the entire definition facility in future
