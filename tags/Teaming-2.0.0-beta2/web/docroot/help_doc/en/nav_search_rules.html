<ol class="steps">
<li class="step" id="bhy57fe">
<div class="formalpara" id="bhy57ix">
              <p class="title"><em class="title">Case Sensitivity:</em>
              If you specify all lowercase letters, then <span class="phrase">Kablink Teaming</span> returns matches in any case ("tree" matches "tree", "Tree", "TReE", and so on). If you specify one or more uppercase letters, <span class="phrase">Kablink Teaming</span> returns only exact matches ("Tree" does not match "tree").</p>
            </div>
</li>
<li class="step" id="bhy57re">
<div class="formalpara" id="bhy57t0">
              <p class="title"><em class="title">More Than One Word:</em>
              <span class="phrase">Kablink Teaming</span> returns items that contain all words in the search string.</p>
            </div>
</li>
<li class="step" id="bhy57zb">
<div class="formalpara" id="bhy582g">
              <p class="title"><em class="title">Quoted Phrase:</em>
              <span class="phrase">Kablink Teaming</span> returns items that match all words in order. Case sensitivity rules apply as described previously.</p>
            </div>
</li>
<li class="step" id="bhy588o">
<div class="formalpara" id="bhy58a0">
              <p class="title"><em class="title">Exclusions:</em>
              To exclude a word (do not return matches for items that contain this word), place a minus sign (-) in front of it. For example, "-tree" excludes all items containing "tree", "Tree", "TREE", and so on.</p>
