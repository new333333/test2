<h1 class="title"> Defining New Roles</h1>

<p class="para">If you find that the existing roles do not meet the needs of your organization, you can modify existing ones or create new ones. This can be particularly useful if you want to delegate the administration of sub-workspaces and sub-folders, and if you do not want to grant all of the privileges that come with the Workspace and folder administration role.</p>
<p class="para">To do this, sign in as a site administrator, then click the <span class="guimenu">Configure role definitions</span> link in the administration portlet. On the Configure Roles page, provide a name for the new role, select check boxes next to the tasks you want members of this role to be able to perform, and click <span class="guimenu">Add</span>. Then navigate to the place where you want to apply the new role, click the <span class="guimenu">Access Control</span> button, click the <span class="guimenu">Add a role</span> link at the top of the table, and select the role in the drop-down list that you want to apply to this table. <span class="phrase">Kablink</span> Teaming then adds a new table column for the new role. Remove and add people, groups, and selections of check boxes as needed.</p>
